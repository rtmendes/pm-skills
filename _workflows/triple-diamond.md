## Overview

The Triple Diamond consists of six phases organized into three diamonds:

```

## When to Use

Use the Triple Diamond when:

- **Starting a new product or major initiative** . need comprehensive discovery and validation
- **Building features with significant uncertainty** . multiple unknowns about users or solutions
- **Establishing a new team or practice** . want structured approach to build discipline
- **Working on high-stakes projects** . cost of failure is high, need thorough validation

Consider a lighter approach (see [feature-kickoff.md](feature-kickoff.md)) when:

- Requirements are well understood
- Building incremental improvements
- Time-constrained rapid development

15. instrumentation-spec    → Plan measurement
16. launch-checklist        → Prepare for launch
17. release-notes           → Communicate to users
         ↓
18. experiment-design       → Plan experiments
19. dashboard-requirements  → Build visibility
20. experiment-results      → Analyze outcomes
