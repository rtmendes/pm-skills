## Scenario

Storevine's growth PM is presenting the Campaigns feature to leadership and cross-functional partners at the quarterly product review. The deck needs to cover why Campaigns matters, what shipped, early adoption metrics, and the Q3 roadmap for Campaigns v2. The PM used the slideshow creator skill to generate a JSON deck specification for an 8-slide presentation.
