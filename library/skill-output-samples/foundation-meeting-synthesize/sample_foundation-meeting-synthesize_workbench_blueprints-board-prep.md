# Sample: foundation-meeting-synthesize. Workbench Blueprints Board Prep

## Scenario

Workbench is preparing for a board meeting in two weeks where Blueprints' enterprise-expansion investment case will be evaluated. PM david-pm synthesizes 5 recaps from Q1 Blueprints meetings with `board-prep` format to produce a board-facing artifact.

Source Notes:
- Workbench is fictional
- HIPAA, SOC 2 Type II are real compliance frameworks
- All metrics `[fictional]`

# Meeting synthesis: Blueprints Enterprise Expansion. Board Prep

## Shareable summary

**Synthesis scope**: Blueprints enterprise-expansion initiative across 5 meetings, 2026-01-01 to 2026-03-31 (board-prep format)

Q1 delivered a strategic pivot: enterprise expansion scoped to regulated industries (healthcare, FSI) rather than general enterprise. Compliance gates (SOC 2 Type II + HIPAA BAA) identified as the primary moat. Sales motion redesigned for 90-day enterprise cycle. Two open decisions for board: compliance investment ($1.2M) and SE hire timing.

**Headline for the board**:
- Strategic pivot: general enterprise → regulated industries (healthcare, FSI)
- Moat identified: compliance gates that incumbents have but most competitors lack
- Sales motion redesigned: 90-day cycle, field + SE pairing

**Top priority items for board decision**:
- Compliance investment: $[fictional] 1.2M for SOC 2 Type II + HIPAA BAA (6-month path)
- SE hire timing: dependent on compliance progress; board to confirm approach

## Full synthesis

### Scope

- **Topic or initiative**: Blueprints enterprise expansion (Q1 strategic review for board)
- **Time range**: 2026-01-01 to 2026-03-31
- **Meetings included** (5):
  - 2026-01-22: Exec Review (scope exploration)
  - 2026-02-05: Compliance Feasibility
  - 2026-02-26: Customer Interviews Debrief (6 healthcare customers)
  - 2026-03-12: Exec Review (scope narrowing)
  - 2026-03-26: Sales Motion Alignment
- **Scope filter applied**: project=blueprints-enterprise-expansion
- **Sources used**: 5 recaps (all structured; 4 high-quality, 1 medium)

### Timeline (compressed for board)

```
2026-01-22  |  Decision to explore enterprise expansion (broad scope)
2026-02-05  |  Compliance path: SOC 2 Type II + HIPAA BAA, [fictional] $1.2M / 6 months
2026-02-26  |  Customer interviews: [fictional] 7 of 8 in healthcare or FSI
2026-03-12  |  Scope narrowed: regulated industries only
2026-03-26  |  Sales motion: 90-day cycle; field + SE pairing
```

### Themes (board-relevant)

#### Strategic pivot [confidence: high. 3/5 meetings drove it]

General enterprise → regulated industries. Evidence-based pivot driven by customer-interview signal and compliance-cost reality. Not scope creep; disciplined narrowing.

#### Compliance as moat [confidence: high. 4/5 meetings referenced]

SOC 2 Type II + HIPAA BAA reframed from overhead cost to strategic capex. Incumbents have these; most direct competitors do not.

#### Sales motion redesign [confidence: medium. 2/5 meetings]

90-day enterprise cycle with field sales + SE pairing. SE hire timing depends on compliance progress.

### Stakeholder position tracking (leadership-relevant)

**jenna-ceo**: exploratory → committed (with pivot) → ready for board

**david-cfo**: skeptical → validator of moat framing → board-ask co-sponsor

**rachel-cmo**: rebuilding positioning from general-enterprise to regulated-industry messaging

### Consolidated decision list

| Date | Decision | Context | Meeting | Confidence |
|------|----------|---------|---------|------------|
| 2026-01-22 | Explore enterprise expansion (broad) | Exec review | Exec Review Jan | high |
| 2026-02-05 | Compliance path: SOC 2 + HIPAA, $1.2M / 6 months | Compliance feasibility | Compliance Feasibility | high |
| 2026-03-12 | Narrow scope to regulated industries | Exec review | Exec Review Mar | high |
| 2026-03-26 | 90-day sales cycle, field + SE pairing | Sales alignment | Sales Motion Alignment | medium |

### Decision evolution (resolved)

**Scope: general enterprise → regulated industries**

- **2026-01-22** (Exec Review Jan): broad exploration
- **2026-03-12** (Exec Review Mar): regulated industries only supersedes
- **Context**: customer-evidence (7/8 in regulated) + compliance-moat framing drove disciplined narrowing

### Unresolved contradictions (⚠)

No live unresolved contradictions as of 2026-03-31.

### Open items (for board decision)

- **Compliance investment**: $[fictional] 1.2M for SOC 2 Type II + HIPAA BAA, 6-month path. Currently unfunded in Q2 budget.
- **SE hire timing**: field hire already approved Q2; SE hire depends on compliance progress (client-presentable by Q3).

### Narrative summary (board-facing)

Q1 Blueprints enterprise-expansion work began as an exploratory bet on general enterprise customers. By end of quarter, it became a disciplined strategic pivot to regulated industries (healthcare, FSI), driven by converging signals: pilot customer interviews (7 of 8 in regulated industries, all citing compliance as decisive) and the compliance-investment analysis ($1.2M / 6 months is feasible and creates durable moat in markets where most competitors lack SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA BAA).

For the board: regulated-industry expansion is higher-value (larger contracts, longer retention), the moat is durable (compliance takes 6 months to achieve, not a weekend project), and the sales motion is being redesigned to match. Two board decisions remain: funding the $1.2M compliance investment, and timing the SE hire.

What would change this picture: a customer shift away from regulated industries in Q2 (unlikely given our pipeline) or a material compliance-cost escalation (low risk. Feb 5 feasibility review was thorough).

### Prioritized follow-up suggestions (board actions)

**[High priority. board decision]**

- Fund $[fictional] 1.2M compliance investment in Q2 budget
- Commit field sales hire in Q2; defer SE hire timing to Q2 compliance-progress checkpoint

**[Medium priority. exec-level monitor]**

- Watch for Q2 regulated-industry competitive shifts; quarterly competitive review

**[Lower priority. informational]**

- Track regulated-industry TAM estimates; consider paid research report in H2
