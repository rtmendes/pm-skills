# Sample: foundation-meeting-synthesize — Brainshelf Resurface Design Iteration Themes

## Scenario

Brainshelf's Resurface team has iterated on the algorithm and UX over 6 small design meetings in Q1. PM priya-pm runs synthesize with default format to extract patterns and surface contradictions in design direction ahead of a direction-decision meeting next week.

# Meeting synthesis: Resurface Design Iteration Q1 2026

## Shareable summary

**Synthesis scope**: Resurface across 6 meetings, 2026-01-15 to 2026-03-31

Q1 iterations converged on recency-weighting (v1) but surfaced an unresolved tension between engagement metrics (favor recency) and user-requested behavior (favor topic-clustering). Next direction meeting should resolve this.

**Key themes**:
- Algorithm iteration: v0 → v1 with recency-weighting; topic-clustering tested but deferred
- Notification copy: converged on shorter/direct after user-feedback session
- UX: bar raised on friction threshold (<5 seconds to engage)

**Top open items**:
- Engagement-vs-intent tension: metrics favor recency; users asked for topic-clustering

**Top priority follow-ups**:
- Direction decision meeting needed to resolve engagement-vs-intent tension

## Full synthesis

### Scope

- **Topic or initiative**: Resurface algorithm + UX iteration
- **Time range**: 2026-01-15 to 2026-03-31
- **Meetings included** (6):
  - 2026-01-20: Resurface Kickoff [medium]
  - 2026-02-03: Algo v0 [high]
  - 2026-02-17: Notification Copy [medium]
  - 2026-03-03: User Feedback Session [high]
  - 2026-03-17: Algo v1 [high]
  - 2026-03-31: UX Refinement [medium]
- **Sources used**: 6 recaps, mixed quality

### Timeline

```
2026-01-20  |  Resurface Kickoff
            |  → Scope: morning digest + notification; algorithm TBD
            |
2026-02-03  |  Algo v0
            |  → Recency-weighted v0 shipped
            |
2026-02-17  |  Notification Copy
            |  → Copy shortened after early usage data ([fictional] 22% open rate too low)
            |
2026-03-03  |  User Feedback Session
            |  → [fictional] 8 users asked for topic-clustering; recency confusing
            |  [!] tension: engagement data favors recency; users want topic-clustering
            |
2026-03-17  |  Algo v1
            |  → Recency-weighted v1 with refinements; topic-clustering parked
            |
2026-03-31  |  UX Refinement
            |  → <5 sec friction threshold set as quality bar
```

### Themes

#### Algorithm iteration converged on recency-weighting [confidence: high — 3/6 meetings resolved]

v0 (Feb 3) → v1 (Mar 17) both used recency-weighting. Iteration refined weights but didn't change approach. Topic-clustering was explored (user-feedback signal) but deferred, not killed.

#### Notification copy converged on shorter/direct [confidence: high — 1/6 meetings resolved]

Feb 17 meeting shortened notification copy based on [fictional] 22% open rate. [fictional] Follow-up data showed open rate lifted to 31% in subsequent weeks.

#### UX friction threshold established [confidence: medium — 1/6 meetings]

Mar 31 meeting set <5 second friction threshold as quality bar. Not tested yet; next sprint will validate.

### Stakeholder position tracking

**elena-algo** — champion of recency-weighting; concerned about topic-clustering implementation complexity

**mia-design** — champion of shorter copy; open to topic-clustering if algo can support

**priya-pm** — deferring topic-clustering; wants user-feedback-signal resolved

### Consolidated decision list

| Date | Decision | Context | Meeting | Confidence |
|------|----------|---------|---------|------------|
| 2026-02-03 | Recency-weighted algo v0 shipped | Algo v0 | Algo v0 | high |
| 2026-02-17 | Shorter notification copy | Notification Copy | Notification Copy | high |
| 2026-03-03 | Topic-clustering parked, not killed | User Feedback Session | User Feedback Session | high |
| 2026-03-17 | Recency-weighted algo v1 shipped | Algo v1 | Algo v1 | high |
| 2026-03-31 | <5 sec friction threshold as quality bar | UX Refinement | UX Refinement | medium |

### Decision evolution (resolved)

None — iterations built on each other without overriding earlier decisions.

### Unresolved contradictions (⚠)

**[!] Engagement metrics vs. user-stated preference**

- **2026-02-03** (Algo v0): recency-weighting chosen for engagement metrics
- **2026-03-03** (User Feedback Session): [fictional] 8 users explicitly asked for topic-clustering
- **Status**: unresolved — metrics favor recency, users request topic-clustering. Next direction meeting should resolve this by committing to one of: (a) stick with recency, explain to users; (b) test topic-clustering in a subset; (c) hybrid.

### Open items and stalled threads

- **Topic-clustering parked without explicit revisit date** — surfaced Mar 3, not re-raised. Risk of silent drop.
- **<5 sec friction threshold** — set but not yet measured; pending sprint validation

### Narrative summary

Resurface iterated steadily through Q1 with recency-weighting as the anchor decision. Copy and UX refinements followed data signals. The one unresolved tension emerged in the March 3 user feedback session: users want topic-clustering, but engagement metrics favor recency. The team parked topic-clustering but has not committed to a resolution path — revisit by when, via what test, with what decision criterion.

Going into Q2, the team should hold a direction meeting that explicitly resolves the engagement-vs-intent tension. Delaying risks either losing the user-stated signal (if recency stays forever) or pivoting too late (if topic-clustering is better and we keep deferring).

### Prioritized follow-up suggestions

**[High priority]**

- Direction meeting within 2 weeks to resolve engagement-vs-intent tension with explicit criterion for choice

**[Medium priority]**

- <5 sec friction threshold validation in next sprint
- Revisit date for topic-clustering (don't silently drop)

**[Lower priority / monitor]**

- Continue tracking notification-copy open rate [fictional] 31% baseline; flag if reverts
