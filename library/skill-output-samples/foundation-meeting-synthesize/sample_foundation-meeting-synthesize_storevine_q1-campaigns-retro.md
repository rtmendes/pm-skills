# Sample: foundation-meeting-synthesize — Storevine Q1 Campaigns Retrospective Input

## Scenario

Storevine completed Q1 research and scoping for the Campaigns feature across 5 meetings between January and March 2026. PM jonathan runs the synthesize skill with `retro-input` format hint to generate a team retrospective artifact for the upcoming Q2 kickoff retrospective.

Source Notes:

# Meeting synthesis: Q1 Campaigns Retrospective Input

## Shareable summary

**Synthesis scope**: Campaigns across 5 meetings, 2026-01-01 to 2026-03-31 (retro-input format)

Q1 Campaigns work completed scope, capacity, and launch decisions on schedule but had a mid-quarter overrun on the user-research round. Three patterns worth retro discussion: research-scope discipline, cross-team handoff to data, and mid-cycle CEO expectation-setting.

**Top retrospective themes**:
- What worked: scope narrowed decisively (one meeting, not three)
- What did not work: research round overran by 18% on unplanned follow-up interviews
- What we did not see coming: CEO's mid-quarter pushback on capacity even though we were on track

**Recommended retro discussion topics**:
- Research-scope discipline: how to commit a research budget upfront
- CEO expectation-setting: signaling capacity status mid-quarter rather than at quarter-end
- Data team handoff: could be smoother with earlier involvement

### Timeline

```
2026-01-14  |  Research Kickoff
            |  → Research scope defined: 12 merchant interviews over 3 weeks
            |
2026-02-04  |  User Interview Debrief
            |  → Strong signal: [fictional] 9 of 12 merchants tired of Klaviyo-juggling
            |  → Unplanned follow-up: 6 more interviews requested on SMS-specific concerns
            |  [!] research overrun begins here
            |
2026-02-25  |  Scope Workshop
            |  → Scope narrowed in one meeting: email + SMS in, segmentation v2 deferred
            |
2026-03-11  |  Capacity Review
            |  → Q2 capacity committed: 8 sprint-weeks
            |  → CEO raised capacity concerns mid-review (emerged, not planned)
            |
2026-03-25  |  Q1 Close-out
            |  → Research overrun absorbed; Q1 deliverables shipped on time
```

### Themes (retro-input format leads with these)

#### What worked: scope narrowed decisively [confidence: high — 1/5 meetings resolved]

Scope workshop on Feb 25 converged in one meeting, not the typical three. Pattern to replicate: pre-work (research synthesis) was done before the meeting, attendees came prepared with positions, and a forcing function (SMS-feasibility question) drove a clear in/out choice.

#### What did not work: research round overran [confidence: high — explicit in Feb 4 and Mar 25 recaps]

User interview debrief surfaced an unexpected signal (SMS-specific concerns) that led to 6 additional interviews beyond the scoped 12. Overrun was [fictional] ~18% on budget. The pattern: no research-scope discipline mechanism to decide whether to add scope or park the signal for later.

#### What we did not see coming: mid-cycle CEO concern [confidence: medium — 1/5 meetings]

Mar 11 capacity review saw CEO priya raise capacity concerns even though the team was on track. Retrospective question: could we have pre-empted by signaling capacity status at end of Feb?

### Stakeholder position tracking

**priya-ceo**

- **Position evolution**: quiet supporter → mid-cycle-concerned → Q1-close-satisfied
- **Retro note**: her mid-cycle concern was likely about optics not reality; earlier signaling might help

**rachel-vp**

- **Position evolution**: steady support throughout
- **Retro note**: aligned through and through; consider her as a pattern for "stable-support stakeholder" going forward

**alex-marketing**

- **Position evolution**: engaged from scope workshop onward (not earlier research)
- **Retro note**: could have been valuable in research kickoff too

### Consolidated decision list

| Date | Decision | Context | Meeting | Confidence |
|------|----------|---------|---------|------------|
| 2026-01-14 | 12-interview research round | Research kickoff | Research Kickoff | high |
| 2026-02-04 | Add 6 follow-up interviews on SMS | User interview debrief | User Interview Debrief | high |
| 2026-02-25 | Scope: email + SMS in, segmentation v2 deferred | Scope workshop | Scope Workshop | high |
| 2026-03-11 | Q2 capacity: 8 sprint-weeks | Capacity review | Capacity Review | high |

### Decision evolution (resolved)

**Scope: initial → narrowed**

- **2026-01-14** (Research Kickoff): exploratory scope including segmentation v2
- **2026-02-25** (Scope Workshop): segmentation v2 deferred; email + SMS only
- **Context**: research signal favored depth over breadth; scope workshop codified

### Unresolved contradictions (⚠)

No live unresolved contradictions as of 2026-03-31.

### Open items and stalled threads

- **Research-scope discipline mechanism**: no process change made yet; candidate for Q2 retro action
- **Data team handoff timing**: sam's team joined at scope workshop; earlier involvement could have accelerated; retro discussion item

### Narrative summary

Q1 Campaigns work delivered on its deliverables (research, scope, capacity commitment) but surfaced three operational patterns worth bringing to retrospective. The scope workshop on Feb 25 was a template for how pre-work + forcing function produces fast decisions; worth replicating. The research overrun on SMS follow-ups highlighted the absence of a research-budget-discipline mechanism — a candidate for a team process change in Q2. The CEO's mid-cycle capacity concern raises a communication question: even when on track, lack of mid-cycle signaling creates anxiety upstream.

Going into Q2, the team has a strong foundation (scope, capacity, customer evidence). The retrospective should focus on what to replicate from the scope-workshop pattern and what to improve from the research-overrun and CEO-signaling patterns.

### Prioritized follow-up suggestions (retro action candidates)

**[High priority]**

- Adopt a research-budget-discipline mechanism: agreed upfront scope with explicit kill/extend criteria
- Mid-cycle capacity signal to CEO: bi-weekly 1-pager update, not quarterly

**[Medium priority]**

- Earlier cross-team involvement pattern: data and marketing leads at research kickoff, not scope workshop

**[Lower priority / monitor]**

- Replicate scope-workshop pattern (pre-work + forcing function) for Q2 scope-critical meetings
