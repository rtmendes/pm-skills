context: Brainshelf consumer PKM app . Resurface feature launch checklist for Sprint 8 ship

## Scenario

As Sprint 8 approached its final days, Priya M. created the Resurface launch checklist to coordinate the ship across engineering, design, growth, and data. The checklist was especially important because this was Brainshelf's first email feature . DNS configuration, deliverability validation, and email compliance were all new operational territory for the team. The checklist was reviewed at the T-2 go/no-go meeting on February 12, 2026, and all blockers were cleared by February 14.

**Source Notes:**

- Atul Gawande, "The Checklist Manifesto" (atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/) . the checklist methodology applied in this document; Gawande's research on the effectiveness of pre-launch checklists in reducing errors in complex, multi-stakeholder processes directly motivated the structured format.
- Intercom, "Shipping Is Your Company's Heartbeat" (intercom.com/blog/shipping-is-your-companys-heartbeat/) . the product launch philosophy that informed the checklist's scope; Intercom's guidance on coordinating cross-functional readiness (engineering, design, marketing, support) rather than treating launch as an engineering-only event shaped the section structure.
- M3AAWG, "Best Practices for Senders" (m3aawg.org/published-documents) . the email deliverability best practices referenced in the Legal & Compliance and Operations sections; the SPF/DKIM/DMARC configuration requirements and sender reputation guidelines are drawn from M3AAWG's sender guidelines.

## Go/No-Go Criteria

### Must Have (Blockers)

- [ ] DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) verified and propagated
- [ ] Digest send pipeline passes end-to-end integration tests (send → deliver → click → event recorded)
- [ ] All P1 edge case test scenarios pass
- [ ] Email renders correctly in Gmail (web + mobile), Apple Mail, and Outlook
- [ ] Unsubscribe flow works end-to-end (one-click from email → digest disabled → confirmation page)
- [ ] Amplitude experiment events are firing correctly in staging
- [ ] On-call rotation confirmed for launch window

### Should Have

- [ ] Seed list test confirms inbox placement (not promotions tab) for Gmail
- [ ] Load test confirms system handles 1,000 concurrent sends [fictional] without errors
- [ ] Dark mode rendering verified across major clients

### Nice to Have

- [ ] FAQ and canned support responses published before launch
- [ ] Twitter/X announcement copy approved

## Rollback Plan

### Trigger Conditions

- Digest send failure rate exceeds 10% for 2 consecutive hours [fictional]
- Unsubscribe rate exceeds 5% per day [fictional] (2.5x the weekly guardrail)
- User reports of digest emails landing in spam (confirmed by 3+ independent reports)
- Critical bug discovered in the click redirect that prevents users from reaching articles

### Rollback Steps

1. Disable the `resurface_enabled` feature flag in Amplitude (stops all digest sends immediately)
2. Post a message in #resurface Slack channel: "Resurface paused . [reason]. Investigating."
3. If the issue is Resend-related, check Resend status page and open a support ticket
4. If the issue is code-related, identify the failing component and deploy a hotfix or revert the relevant PR
5. Re-enable the feature flag only after the root cause is resolved and the fix is verified in staging

### Rollback Owner

Alex R. . #resurface Slack channel, PagerDuty on-call

### Rollback Time Estimate

Feature flag disable: <1 minute. Hotfix deployment: ~30 minutes [fictional] (PR → review → merge → deploy).

| Amplitude experiment SDK integration not yet complete | Chloe B. | In progress (Sprint 7) | Risk . if delayed, A/B variant assignment must be handled manually |
| Privacy policy may need update for email data processing | Priya M. | Under review | Risk . must be resolved before opt-in enrollment (Mar 2) |
