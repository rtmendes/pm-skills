# Sample Output 03 - deliver-launch-checklist

Skill: deliver-launch-checklist
Thread: Workbench (enterprise collaboration platform)
Persona: Rachel V., Technical PM, Blueprints

## Scenario

Blueprints v1 is two weeks from GA launch (target: April 2026). The A/B test results confirmed the required-section hypothesis: time-to-approved dropped 40% from 4.0 to 2.4 days [fictional] (p=0.001), and Sandra C. gave the ship decision on April 14, 2026. Rachel V. is assembling the cross-functional launch checklist to coordinate engineering, QA, design, marketing, customer support, legal, and operations for the rollout from 80 closed-beta accounts [fictional] to all 500 enterprise customers [fictional]. The A/B results also showed that the empty-section rate dropped from 38% to 7% [fictional], validating the core enforcement mechanism and giving the team confidence to ship required sections as the default behavior.

Key launch risks include: SAML SSO certification timing, Confluence migration messaging for accounts switching from competitor tools, and ensuring the IT admin provisioning guide is ready before enterprise security teams begin onboarding.

## Prompt

```
/launch-checklist

I need a comprehensive launch checklist for Blueprints v1 GA. Here's the context:

**Launch details:**
- Launch name: Blueprints GA
- Target date: April 28, 2026
- Rollout: From 80 closed-beta accounts to all ~500 enterprise customers [fictional]
- Ship decision confirmed by Sandra C. on April 14, 2026

**Key stakeholders:**
- Rachel V. (PM), Karen L. (Eng Lead), Tomás G. (Design Lead), Derek H. (Head of Marketing), Mei-Lin T. (Enterprise Sales Lead), James W. (VP Eng)

**Critical items I'm tracking:**
- SAML SSO certification -- must be complete before GA (enterprise blocker)
- IT admin provisioning guide -- enterprise security teams need this before they'll onboard
- Confluence migration communication plan -- many prospects are switching from Confluence
- A/B test code cleanup -- remove experiment flags, ship required-sections as default
- WebSocket provider scaling -- validated at 80 accounts, need to load test for 500

**Rollback concern:** If a critical bug surfaces in the first 48 hours, we need a clean rollback to the pre-Blueprints state without data loss for accounts that already created Blueprints during GA.

Please generate the full launch checklist with go/no-go criteria and a rollback plan.

## Rollback Plan

### Trigger Conditions

Initiate rollback if any of the following occur within the first 48 hours post-launch:

1. Data loss confirmed: any Blueprint content lost due to CRDT merge failure or storage corruption
2. Approval-state corruption: Blueprints stuck in inconsistent approval states that cannot be resolved without manual database intervention
3. WebSocket provider outage exceeding 30 minutes with no ETA from the provider
4. Security vulnerability discovered in SSO integration or audit log pipeline
5. Error rate exceeds 5% on any Blueprint lifecycle event (create, submit, approve) for more than 15 minutes

### Rollback Steps

1. **Disable feature flag** (`blueprints_ga_enabled` set to off) via LaunchDarkly. This immediately hides Blueprints UI from all non-beta accounts. Estimated time: 2 minutes.
2. **Preserve existing data**: All Blueprints created during GA remain in the database. They are hidden from the UI but not deleted. Authors can access their content once Blueprints is re-enabled.
3. **Notify affected accounts**: Trigger a pre-drafted email to accounts that created Blueprints during the GA window explaining the temporary rollback and ETA for restoration. Template pre-loaded in the transactional email system.
4. **Revert WebSocket scaling**: Scale down the WebSocket provider to beta-level capacity to reduce cost during the rollback period.
5. **Conduct incident review**: Rachel V. convenes a 30-minute sync within 2 hours of rollback to assess root cause and define the re-launch criteria.
6. **Re-enable progressively**: Once the root cause is fixed and verified on staging, re-enable the feature flag at 10% and monitor for 4 hours before resuming the full rollout schedule.

### Rollback Owner

Karen L. (Engineering Lead), primary rollback executor
James W. (VP Engineering), escalation and communication approval

### Rollback Time Estimate

- Feature flag disable: 2 minutes
- Full UI rollback confirmed across all accounts: 5 minutes (CDN cache TTL)
- Affected-account notification sent: 15 minutes
- Total time from trigger to stable rollback state: approximately 20 minutes
