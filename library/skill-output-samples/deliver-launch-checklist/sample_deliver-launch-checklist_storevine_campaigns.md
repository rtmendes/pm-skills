## Scenario

Four weeks before the Campaigns GA date of April 28, 2026, Storevine's growth PM compiled the launch checklist to coordinate readiness across engineering, design, legal, merchant success, and marketing. The checklist reflects the unusual compliance complexity of a production email send feature — where legal sign-off is a hard blocker and DMARC/SPF/DKIM sender authentication is a technical prerequisite for inbox delivery, not a nice-to-have.

**Source Notes:**

- CAN-SPAM Act (FTC, ftc.gov) and GDPR Article 6 (gdpr.eu) — the legal requirements that make the Legal & Compliance section items non-negotiable blockers rather than optional pre-launch review steps; any production email send without Legal sign-off creates direct regulatory exposure.
- Google, "Email Sender Guidelines" (support.google.com/mail/answer/81126) and Yahoo's sender requirements (help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN27791) — the 2024 enforcement of DKIM, SPF, and DMARC authentication as prerequisites for inbox delivery to Gmail and Yahoo accounts, which represent the majority of merchant customer inboxes, making sender authentication a launch-gate infrastructure item.
- SendGrid, "IP Warm-Up Overview" (sendgrid.com/blog/warming-up-your-ip-address/) — documents the required gradual volume ramp for new dedicated sending IPs to establish sender reputation with inbox providers before full-volume merchant sends are enabled at GA.

/launch-checklist

Feature: Campaigns v1.0 — native email marketing for Storevine merchants
Launch date: April 28, 2026
Launch type: Major Release
Launch owner: Growth PM

Key compliance and infrastructure requirements:
- Legal sign-off on CAN-SPAM + GDPR required before any production send
- DMARC/SPF/DKIM sender authentication required for Gmail/Yahoo inbox
  delivery (enforced by Google and Yahoo since 2024)
- SendGrid dedicated IP warm-up plan needed before full-volume sends
- Feature flag rollout: start at 10% of merchants [fictional], scale
  to 100% over 2 weeks based on send failure rates

Stakeholders:
- Engineering Lead (Platform Squad)
- Merchant Success (launch comms + support)
- Legal (CAN-SPAM/GDPR review)
- Storevine Marketing (announcement + dog-food)

Key risks from stakeholder summary:
- Legal review not started; hard gate on compliance sign-off
- Klaviyo partner team needs 48-hour advance notice before GA announcement
- Power-user merchant beta cohort expectations may exceed v1 scope

Need: full pre-launch checklist with go/no-go criteria, rollback plan,
and check-in schedule.

## Legal & Compliance

| Item | Owner | Due | Status | Notes |
|------|-------|-----|--------|-------|

| [ ] Terms of service updated (email marketing section, subscriber data handling) | Legal | Apr 14 | | Updated ToS must be live before GA; existing merchants are notified via in-app |
| [ ] Privacy policy updated (subscriber data collection, 7-day attribution window retention language) | Legal | Apr 14 | | Privacy policy must reflect the new attribution events data collected for each send |
| [ ] SendGrid data processing agreement reviewed (merchant subscriber data handled by SendGrid) | Legal | Apr 14 | | Storevine routes merchant subscriber data through SendGrid; DPA must be in place |

## Operations & Infrastructure

| Item | Owner | Due | Status | Notes |
|------|-------|-----|--------|-------|
| [ ] SendGrid dedicated IP provisioned and warm-up plan active | Platform Squad | Apr 14 | | IP warm-up must begin 2 weeks before GA to establish sender reputation before full-volume sends |
| [ ] DMARC, SPF, and DKIM configured for Campaigns sending domain | Platform Squad | Apr 21 | | **Launch gate:** Gmail and Yahoo require authentication for bulk senders; unconfigured sending domain results in deliverability failures |
| [ ] SSL certificates valid for Campaigns sending domain | Platform Squad | Apr 21 | | Verify certificate expiry dates; renew if expiring within 60 days |
| [ ] Attribution events table included in daily backup | Platform Squad | Apr 25 | | New table must be added to the backup job before GA |
| [ ] Incident response runbook created (Campaigns-specific: send failures, attribution backlog) | Engineering Lead | Apr 25 | | Runbook covers: how to check send queue depth, how to drain attribution event backlog, how to set feature flag to 0% |
| [ ] On-call rotation confirmed for GA week | Engineering Lead | Apr 25 | | Platform Squad on-call for the full GA week; escalation path to Engineering Lead confirmed |

## Analytics & Monitoring

| Item | Owner | Due | Status | Notes |
|------|-------|-----|--------|-------|
| [ ] Analytics events instrumented (campaign_created, campaign_sent, first_send, attribution_recorded) | Backend Engineer | Apr 25 | | All events from instrumentation spec implemented and firing in staging |
| [ ] Campaigns adoption dashboard created (first-send rate, send volume, attribution revenue) | Growth PM | Apr 25 | | Dashboard needed for the T+1 day review and ongoing hypothesis tracking |
| [ ] Send failure rate alert configured (trigger at >2% failure rate [fictional]) | Platform Squad | Apr 25 | | Alert routes to #campaigns-build Slack; threshold: 2% [fictional] of sends failing over any 15-minute window |
| [ ] Attribution event backlog alert configured (trigger at >500 unprocessed events [fictional]) | Platform Squad | Apr 25 | | Indicates webhook receiver is behind; alert routes to on-call engineer |
| [ ] Success metrics baselined (first-send rate, external email tool count, churn rate) | Growth PM | Apr 14 | | Pre-GA baseline locked 2 weeks before launch; post-GA metrics compared against this baseline |
| [ ] SendGrid event delivery logging active (open, click, unsubscribe, spam complaint) | Backend Engineer | Apr 25 | | Events logged to the attribution events table and to a Campaigns event log for debugging |

## Go/No-Go Criteria

### Must Have (Blockers)

- [ ] Legal sign-off on CAN-SPAM compliance architecture — no production email send capability enabled without this
- [ ] DMARC, SPF, and DKIM configured and verified for the Campaigns sending domain
- [ ] All P1 edge cases passing in QA (per edge cases document)
- [ ] Merchant Success training complete and canned responses approved
- [ ] Feature flag configured for 10% [fictional] gradual rollout with confirmed path to 100% or 0%

### Should Have

- [ ] Beta merchant UAT complete with no blocker-level feedback from the 5-merchant discovery cohort [fictional]
- [ ] Klaviyo partner notice email sent 48 hours before GA announcement (April 26, 2026)
- [ ] Demo video of guided first-campaign flow published on GA day

### Nice to Have

- [ ] P2 edge cases passing in QA
- [ ] EU merchant GDPR consent data model complete (deferred to v1.1 if not ready)
- [ ] Merchant testimonial in GA social media content

## Rollback Plan

### Trigger Conditions

- Send failure rate exceeds 5% [fictional] over any 60-minute window after GA
- A CAN-SPAM violation is reported (unsubscribe link absent or non-functional in a sent campaign)
- Attribution webhook receiver failure causes more than 1,000 unprocessed events to accumulate [fictional]
- A merchant data breach or unauthorized access to the subscriber data pipeline is detected

### Rollback Steps

1. Set the Campaigns feature flag to 0% — disables the Campaigns admin entry point for all merchants within 2 minutes of the flag change; in-flight sends already submitted to SendGrid are not recalled
2. Post a Storevine status page update: "Campaigns is temporarily unavailable — we're addressing an issue and will restore access shortly"
3. Verify that no campaigns remain queued in the SendGrid pipeline that have not yet been submitted; drain the queue or cancel pending sends as appropriate
4. Page the Engineering Lead and Platform Squad on-call for root cause analysis
5. Do not re-enable the feature flag until root cause is identified and resolved; do not set flag above 0% without Head of Product approval

### Rollback Owner

Engineering Lead — reachable via on-call PagerDuty [fictional]

### Rollback Time Estimate

Under 5 minutes (feature flag toggle to 0% takes effect within 2 minutes of change)

## Check-in Schedule

| Checkpoint | Date | Attendees |
|------------|------|-----------|
| T-7 days readiness review | April 21, 2026 | Growth PM, Engineering Lead, Design Lead, Merchant Success Lead |
| T-2 days go/no-go decision | April 26, 2026 | Growth PM, Engineering Lead, Head of Product |
| GA day launch sync | April 28, 2026, 9:00 AM | Growth PM, Engineering Lead, Merchant Success Lead |
| T+1 day review | April 29, 2026 | Growth PM, Engineering Lead, Head of Product |

## Open Issues

| Issue | Owner | Status | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| EU merchant GDPR consent data model | Legal | In progress | Risk: if Legal review is not complete by Apr 14, EU merchant access is confirmed as v1.1; not a blocker for US GA |
| Klaviyo partner notice email | Growth PM | Scheduled for Apr 26 | Risk: if not sent 48 hours before GA announcement, Klaviyo partnership team learns about Campaigns from a press release — medium partnership friction risk |
| Power-user merchant beta expectations | Merchant Success | Managed | Risk: discovery cohort participants have expectations from Jan interviews; Merchant Success will brief them on v1 scope at beta access (T-4 weeks) before GA |
