## Scenario

Workbench is a Series B enterprise collaboration platform (~200 employees, ~500 enterprise customers [fictional]) that has completed discovery, define, and early develop work for Blueprints. Rachel V. (Technical PM) wrote a solution brief to communicate the Blueprints feature to Sandra C. (Head of Product), Derek H. (Head of Marketing), and Mei-Lin T. (Enterprise Sales Lead) as a single-page overview before the PRD is written. The brief consolidates decisions from the CRDT spike (Yjs selected), the design rationale (hybrid wizard/canvas), and the problem statement (38% incomplete submission rate [fictional]). Because the brief serves as the primary alignment artifact across product, marketing, and sales, Rachel structured it to give each audience what they need: Sandra sees the strategic framing, Derek gets the competitive positioning, and Mei-Lin gets the feature-level detail for enterprise conversations.

**Source Notes:**

- Microsoft's Work Trend Index 2023 reported that knowledge workers spend 8.8 hours per week searching for or recreating documents, the cost baseline that Blueprints governance aims to address.
- Atlassian's FY2024 Annual Report reported approximately $4.35 billion in total revenue, establishing Confluence as the enterprise documentation market leader that Blueprints is positioned to displace for governance-focused buyers.
- G2's Enterprise Collaboration category reviews cite "docs created but not maintained" as the top Confluence complaint in enterprise reviews.

## Prompt

```
/solution-brief

Product: Workbench Blueprints -- reusable document templates with required sections and role-based approval gates
Stage: Pre-PRD; consolidating decisions from discovery, define, and develop phases into a one-pager

Problem recap:
- 38% of enterprise documents reach approval with >=1 empty required section [fictional]
- Median time to first approval: 4.0 days [fictional]; most of that is rejection-revision cycles
- 60% of enterprise projects lack an approved kickoff doc at handoff [fictional]
- No doc-first competitor enforces template section completion

Proposed solution:
- Blueprint templates with required and optional sections, designated by template admins
- Required-section enforcement at submission (Submit button disabled until all required sections complete)
- Native role-based approval gates (single-stage approval in v1; multi-stage in v1.1)
- Real-time co-editing via Yjs CRDTs (offline-first, 20+ concurrent editors [fictional])
- Hybrid creation flow: guided wizard for first-time authors, blank canvas for returning authors
- SAML SSO, audit logs, and SCIM provisioning for enterprise deployment

Key features (5):
1. Required-section enforcement
2. Native approval gates
3. Yjs-powered co-editing
4. Hybrid wizard/canvas creation flow
5. Enterprise security (SAML, audit logs, SCIM)

Success metrics:
- Median time to first approval: 4.0 days -> <=2.5 days [fictional]
- Approval rejection rate: 38% -> <=15% [fictional]
- Enterprise accounts with active Blueprints: 200 of 500 within 6 months of GA [fictional]
- Enterprise churn (compliance segment): 18% -> <=12% within 12 months [fictional]

Trade-offs: No AI-assisted drafting in v1 (Partial per competitive analysis); no multi-stage approval in v1; no Confluence template import in v1 (guided manual migration only)

Risks: CRDT complexity (mitigated by spike); author abandonment from enforcement (mitigated by A/B test); Atlassian Rovo response (monitor)

Stakeholders: Sandra C. (Head of Product), Derek H. (Head of Marketing), Mei-Lin T. (Enterprise Sales Lead)

## Output

# Solution Brief: Workbench Blueprints

## Problem Recap

Enterprise teams use document templates to standardize project kickoffs, vendor onboarding, compliance reviews, and architecture decisions, but no tool in the enterprise collaboration market enforces template completion before a document enters an approval workflow. In Workbench's closed beta (80 enterprise accounts [fictional]), 38% of Blueprints reach the approval stage with at least one empty required section [fictional], triggering rejection-revision cycles that inflate median approval time to 4.0 days [fictional]. Downstream, 60% of enterprise projects lack an approved kickoff document at the time of project handoff [fictional], creating compliance risk and project delays. The cost of these delays compounds at the organizational level: incomplete kickoff documents are the single most cited reason for scope disagreements in post-project retrospectives across the beta cohort [fictional].

The competitive landscape confirms this as a structural gap: Confluence has templates but no enforcement. Notion has templates but no governance. Monday.com has approval workflows but is not a document tool. No competitor occupies the upper-right quadrant of governance rigor combined with fast adoption. This positioning gives Workbench a clear wedge into compliance-sensitive enterprise segments where documentation quality is a regulatory or operational requirement.

## Proposed Solution

Workbench Blueprints is a document template system with required-section enforcement and native role-based approval gates, built for enterprise teams that need governance without manual policing. Template admins designate which sections are required. Authors cannot submit a Blueprint for approval until all required sections are completed. Approvers receive complete documents and make substantive decisions rather than completeness checks.

The creation experience adapts to author experience: a guided wizard walks first-time authors through each required section, while returning authors see a blank canvas for efficient editing. Real-time co-editing powered by Yjs CRDTs enables simultaneous authoring with offline-first support, so field teams and remote contributors can work without connectivity and merge changes seamlessly on reconnect. Enterprise security features (SAML SSO, audit log export, SCIM provisioning) ensure deployment readiness for IT security teams and reduce procurement friction for new accounts.

## Key Features

1. **Required-section enforcement.** Template admins designate sections as required. The Submit for Approval button is disabled until all required sections are completed. Inline validation highlights incomplete sections with guidance text. This is the core differentiator: no competitor has it. During closed beta, required-section enforcement reduced the empty-section rate from 38% to 7% [fictional], confirming the hypothesis that submission gating eliminates the majority of incomplete submissions.

2. **Native approval gates.** Single-stage approval workflow built into the document experience. Authors submit for approval; designated approvers review and approve or reject inline. Approval status, history, and audit trail are tracked on the document. Eliminates the need for separate approval tools (SharePoint, email chains). Sequential and parallel approval modes give template admins flexibility to match their organization's review process.

3. **Yjs-powered real-time co-editing.** CRDT-based collaboration via Yjs with the y-prosemirror binding. Supports 20+ concurrent editors per Blueprint [fictional] with sub-100ms merge latency [fictional]. Offline-first: edits made while disconnected are queued locally and merged automatically on reconnect. Sub-document support enables section-level lazy loading for large Blueprints. The 5-day CRDT spike validated 45ms median merge latency and 32ms actual under typical load [fictional].

4. **Hybrid wizard/canvas creation flow.** First-time authors see a step-by-step wizard that guides them through each required section. Returning authors (who have completed at least one Blueprint from the same template) see a blank canvas with all sections visible. Authors can skip the wizard at any time. Auto-disables for templates with 12+ sections [fictional]. A preference test with 8 closed-beta users confirmed the split: 6 preferred the wizard on first use, 5 preferred the canvas by their second Blueprint [fictional].

5. **Enterprise security suite.** SAML 2.0 SSO for enterprise identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin). SCIM provisioning for automated user lifecycle management. Audit log export (CSV/JSON) for compliance teams. Data residency options for EU-based customers. These capabilities address the top three IT security objections encountered during enterprise sales conversations [fictional].

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current Baseline | Target | Timeline |
|--------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| Median time to first approval | 4.0 days [fictional] | <=2.5 days [fictional] | 8 weeks post-GA |
| Approval rejection rate | 38% [fictional] | <=15% [fictional] | 8 weeks post-GA |
| Enterprise accounts with active Blueprints | 0 | 200 of 500 [fictional] | 6 months post-GA |
| Enterprise churn (compliance segment) | 18% annual [fictional] | <=12% annual [fictional] | 12 months post-GA |
| Author-side abandonment | N/A | <=20% [fictional] | Guardrail; ongoing |

## Trade-offs Considered

| Included in v1 | Excluded from v1 | Rationale |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| Required-section enforcement | AI-assisted section drafting | AI is Partial per competitive analysis; enforcement is the core differentiator. AI drafting deferred to post-GA roadmap. |
| Single-stage approval | Multi-stage approval chains | Most closed-beta accounts use single-stage approval. Multi-stage (manager then compliance then dept head) deferred to v1.1 based on demand signal. |
| Guided manual migration | Automated Confluence template import | Import tool is M effort and requires mapping arbitrary Confluence HTML to Blueprint sections. Guided manual migration (S effort) is sufficient for GA; import explored post-GA. |
| SAML SSO + audit logs | SOC 2 Type II certification | SOC 2 is an organizational process (6-12 months) that runs in parallel with product development. Readiness assessment underway; certification targeted for Q4 2026. |
| Desktop authoring | Mobile authoring | Enterprise document creation is overwhelmingly desktop. Mobile authoring deferred to post-GA. |

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Required-section enforcement causes author abandonment | Medium | High | A/B test in closed beta (Mar 9 - Apr 5, 2026); abandonment is a primary guardrail metric monitored daily. If treatment abandonment exceeds control by 15pp at week 1, pause. The hybrid wizard also softens the enforcement experience for first-time authors. |
| Yjs CRDT integration introduces performance regressions in the core editor | Low | High | CRDT spike validated performance (45ms merge latency at 20 concurrent editors [fictional]). Production integration isolated behind feature flag; can be disabled without affecting non-Blueprints editing. Nate P. will run additional load tests at 50 concurrent editors during Sprint 1 to confirm scaling headroom [fictional]. |
| Atlassian ships enforcement features in Confluence (Rovo AI agent or template enforcement) | Low | Medium | Monitor Atlassian Team '26 announcements (anticipated April 2026). Workbench's 6-month head start and native approval gates provide a moat even if Confluence adds basic enforcement. |
| Mei-Lin's enterprise deals close before GA, forcing premature feature promises | Medium | Medium | Align with Mei-Lin on "v1 closes deals; v1.1 expands them" narrative. Battle card and competitive one-pager scoped to v1 feature set only. |
| Closed-beta migrant accounts churn during migration | Low | Medium | Dedicated Customer Success manager for the 5 highest-value migrant accounts [fictional]. Weekly health checks during first 30 days. |
