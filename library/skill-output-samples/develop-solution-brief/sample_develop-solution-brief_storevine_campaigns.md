## Scenario

With the PRD finalized and the engineering ADR signed off, Storevine's growth PM prepared a one-page solution brief to brief the head of product and the executive team before the engineering kickoff. The brief distills the full Campaigns PRD into the problem, the solution, and the five features shipping in v1 — without the implementation detail that belongs in the engineering handoff.

**Source Notes:**

- DMA (Data & Marketing Association, dma.org.uk) research on email marketing ROI documents median returns of £42 per £1 spent for retail senders, establishing email as the highest-ROI marketing channel available to small ecommerce merchants and the strategic stakes of a platform gap in this capability.
- Shopify's FY2023 Annual Report identifies Shopify Email and the broader merchant solutions suite as a primary platform retention lever, validating that native email tooling is a proven retention investment for commerce platforms serving the SMB segment.
- The CAN-SPAM Act (FTC, ftc.gov) and GDPR Article 6 (gdpr.eu) define the compliance requirements for commercial email that make Legal sign-off a non-negotiable launch gate for any production email send capability.

Project: Campaigns — native email marketing for Storevine merchants

I need a one-page brief for a head of product review before engineering
kickoff. Full PRD already written and reviewed with engineering lead.
This brief is for executive context, not the build team.

Problem (3 sentences max):
- 68% of active merchants use external email tools [fictional]
- Built-in tools lack segmentation + attribution
- 22% churn cited email gaps as a top-3 reason [fictional]

Solution: native email within Storevine admin — no separate tool
subscription, no sync required

v1 features to include:
- Purchase-based audience segments (pre-built, seeded from Storevine data)
- Guided first-campaign flow (product-seeded templates)
- Revenue attribution (SendGrid webhook → order database)
- CAN-SPAM/GDPR compliance built in
- Abandoned cart automation

Success metrics, trade-offs (what we're NOT building), and top risks.

## Output

# Solution Brief: Campaigns — Native Email Marketing for Storevine Merchants

## Problem Recap

Sixty-eight percent of active Storevine merchants [fictional] use a third-party email tool — primarily Klaviyo or Mailchimp — because the platform's built-in email features lack purchase-based audience segmentation and revenue attribution. Q4 exit surveys confirmed that 22% [fictional] of merchants who canceled cited email gaps as a primary reason, making this the highest-ROI retention investment currently on the roadmap.

## Proposed Solution

Campaigns is a native email marketing feature built into the Storevine admin that gives merchants targeted, attribution-tracked email campaigns without a separate subscription, API configuration, or data sync. Merchants' existing customer and order data is available in Campaigns from day one — no setup required. The feature targets the 38% [fictional] of active merchants who currently have no email program (non-adopters) as the primary v1 launch segment, with a guided first-send experience designed to produce a first campaign in under 15 minutes.

## Key Features

1. **Purchase-based audience segments:** Pre-built named segments seeded directly from Storevine order data — "Customers who purchased in the last 90 days," "First-time buyers," "Customers who haven't ordered in 6 months" — available at account activation with no export or sync required.

2. **Guided first-campaign flow:** A setup path that pre-populates an email template with the merchant's top products and an automatically filtered audience, reducing the blank-canvas abandonment that currently drives a 12% [fictional] first-send completion rate among non-adopters.

3. **Revenue attribution:** Open and click events from SendGrid are linked to subsequent Storevine purchase records via a 7-day attribution window, giving merchants a direct answer to "which email drove which sales" — the most common reason merchants cite for choosing Klaviyo over a built-in tool.

4. **CAN-SPAM/GDPR compliance built in:** Unsubscribe link, physical sender address, and EU consent tracking are automatic in every send — no merchant configuration required and no Legal exposure from a merchant who did not know the requirements.

5. **Abandoned cart automation:** A pre-configured trigger email to customers who add products to cart but do not complete checkout within 4 hours — the single highest-ROI automation for ecommerce merchants, requiring no flow-building experience to activate.

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| First campaign send rate (non-adopter segment, 60 days post-GA) | 12% [fictional] | 30% [fictional] | 60 days post-GA |
| Email-related annual churn contribution | 4.8 pp [fictional] | 2.4 pp [fictional] | Q4 2026 |
| % of active merchants using external email tool | 68% [fictional] | 50% [fictional] | Q4 2026 |

## Trade-offs Considered

| What We're Not Doing | Why |
|---------------------|-----|
| Klaviyo migration tooling (list import wizard, flow migration) | Klaviyo-integrated merchants have structural switching costs (data lock-in, workflow dependency) that require a dedicated migration product; v1 targets non-adopters who have no migration cost |
| A/B testing for subject lines and content | Non-adopters do not need optimization tooling on their first send; shipping A/B testing in v1 would add engineering complexity without serving the primary target segment |
| SMS campaigns | Incremental compliance overhead (TCPA in the US, additional GDPR requirements for EU) is disproportionate to v1 scope; merchants who need SMS are predominantly already on Klaviyo and are not the primary target |
| White-labeling a third-party email platform | Deep integration with Storevine order and customer data requires native implementation; a white-labeled tool would not support the zero-setup, always-synced data model that is Campaigns' primary competitive differentiator |

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Legal review surfaces GDPR data model changes mid-build | Medium | High | Submit CAN-SPAM/GDPR requirements brief to Legal by Mar 1, 2026 — four weeks before backend build begins; scope EU merchant access as a v1.1 contingency if review is not complete by GA |
| Revenue attribution engineering overrun | Low | High | Attribution spike completed Feb 18; schema and API contract defined; estimated M effort [fictional] within current Q2 squad capacity |
| Klaviyo partner surprise at GA announcement | Medium | Medium | Proactive 48-hour email to Klaviyo partnership contact before public GA; lead with "complementary, not a replacement" framing and v1 feature gap data |

## Next Steps

1. Engineering kickoff — Engineering Lead, March 3, 2026
2. Submit CAN-SPAM/GDPR brief to Legal — Growth PM, March 1, 2026
3. Design review of guided first-campaign flow Figma specs — Design + PM, February 27, 2026
