# Sample: foundation-meeting-recap — Workbench Blueprints Customer Feedback Review

## Scenario

Workbench held a 60-minute stakeholder review on 2026-04-25 to walk 6 enterprise customers through the Blueprints v1.1 approval-gate design (from working session 2026-04-28 — simulated prior) and collect feedback. Five attendees: david-pm, sasha-designer, linda-compliance, raj-eng, and anna-cs (customer success lead joining to capture customer-voice context). Transcript from Zoom + structured notes from anna. Rich enterprise context; thorough recap.

Source Notes:
- Workbench is fictional
- All customer names are `[fictional]`
- HIPAA, SOC 2 are real compliance frameworks

## Full recap

### Meeting details

- **Date**: 2026-04-25
- **Actual duration**: 60 min (on time)
- **Attendees present**: david-pm, sasha-designer, linda-compliance, raj-eng, anna-cs
- **Recording**: https://meet.example/blueprints-v1-1-feedback

### Overall summary

Reviewed the approval-gate design with 6 enterprise customers over the past two weeks (anna-cs led customer interviews). Today's meeting consolidated themes. Three must-fix items surfaced, three nice-to-haves parked. No blockers for v1.1. Team capacity confirmed sufficient for must-fixes. Ship target 2026-06-15 holds.

### Agenda reconciliation

- **Planned topics**: design-walkthrough, customer-feedback-themes, must-fix-items, nice-to-have-items
- **Topics addressed**: all 4 (4 of 4)
- **Topics skipped**: none
- **Topics emerged**: none

### Topics

#### Design walkthrough

*Type: Information (from agenda)*

**Discussion**

Sasha walked the current approval-gate design. Linda confirmed compliance conformance (HIPAA workflow requirements met). Raj noted implementation is 70% complete.

**Decisions made**

- None (walkthrough for context)

**Actions**

- None

---

#### Customer feedback themes

*Type: Information (from agenda)*

**Discussion**

Anna presented themes from 6 customer interviews:

- **Theme 1**: Audit-log granularity: [fictional] 5 of 6 customers flagged current audit log lacks "who approved what, when" granularity for HIPAA-audit compliance
- **Theme 2**: Bulk-amend flow: [fictional] 4 of 6 customers requested bulk-amend workflow (current design only supports single-doc amendment)
- **Theme 3**: Role-based approval shortcut: [fictional] 3 of 6 customers asked for role-based skip rules (auto-approve if role matches criteria)
- **Theme 4**: Mobile-responsive approval UI: [fictional] 2 of 6 mentioned this; lower priority
- **Theme 5**: Exportable approval reports: [fictional] 2 of 6 mentioned; tooling-integration dependency
- **Theme 6**: Custom approval status labels: [fictional] 1 of 6 raised; edge case

**Decisions made**

- None (theme intake for next decision)

**Actions**

- None

---

#### Must-fix items

*Type: Decision (from agenda)*

**Discussion**

Applied 5-of-6 threshold (majority-signal) as must-fix criterion. Themes 1, 2, 3 pass threshold.

**Decisions made**

- **Must-fix for v1.1**: audit-log granularity (Theme 1), bulk-amend flow (Theme 2), role-based approval shortcut (Theme 3) — rationale: 3+ of 6 customers cited these; compliance and workflow dependencies
- **Capacity fit confirmed**: raj confirmed 3 items fit within v1.1 capacity (4 eng-days of work)

**Actions**

- [ ] sasha-designer: update approval-flow design for audit-log granularity + bulk-amend | Due: 2026-05-02
- [ ] sasha-designer: design role-based approval shortcut configuration UX | Due: 2026-05-06
- [ ] raj-eng: size must-fix items against v1.1 capacity + confirm ship date | Due: 2026-04-30
- [ ] linda-compliance: validate updated designs against HIPAA requirements before implementation | Due: 2026-05-08

**Open questions**

- Role-based shortcut: default-on or default-off? [confidence: medium — flag for linda]

---

#### Nice-to-have items

*Type: Decision (from agenda)*

**Discussion**

Themes 4, 5, 6 parked to v1.2 backlog with rationale.

**Decisions made**

- **Parked to v1.2**: mobile-responsive approval UI, exportable approval reports, custom approval status labels — rationale: low signal (<3 of 6 customers); dependencies on other initiatives (tooling integration); edge-case for label customization

**Actions**

- [ ] david-pm: log Themes 4, 5, 6 in v1.2 backlog with customer-citation | Due: 2026-04-30
- [ ] anna-cs: schedule 3 customer follow-ups after v1.1 ships for validation | Due: 2026-06-20

**Open questions**

- None
