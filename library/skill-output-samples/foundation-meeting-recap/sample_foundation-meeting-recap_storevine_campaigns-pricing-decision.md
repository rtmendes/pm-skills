## Full recap

### Meeting details

- **Date**: 2026-04-24
- **Actual duration**: 50 min (ran 5 over)
- **Attendees present**: jonathan-pm, maria-eng, alex-marketing, sam-data
- **Recording**: https://meet.example/campaigns-pricing-recording

### Overall summary

All three planned decisions landed: two-tier structure ($19 / $49), 12-month grandfathering for beta users, and 2026-06-10 rollout. An emergent question on comms-plan ownership was resolved (alex-marketing owns). Meeting ran 5 minutes over due to the comms-plan discussion.

### Agenda reconciliation

- **Planned topics**: tier-structure, grandfathering, rollout-date
- **Topics addressed**: tier-structure, grandfathering, rollout-date (3 of 3)
- **Topics emerged**: comms-plan-ownership. arose from discussion of rollout-date transition communication

### Topics

#### Tier structure

*Type: Decision (from agenda)*

**Discussion**

Reviewed three options from the pricing proposal: single-tier, two-tier, and three-tier. Competitive reference: Klaviyo's pricing structure (real). Sam's data showed [fictional] 68% of current Campaigns beta users correlate with Storevine merchants earning $10K-$100K/mo GMV, supporting a two-tier model matching merchant revenue bands.

**Decisions made**

- **Two-tier structure: Campaigns Starter at $19/mo [fictional], Campaigns Pro at $49/mo [fictional]**. rationale: matches merchant-revenue distribution; simpler to communicate than three-tier; leaves room for future Enterprise tier without promising it now

**Actions**

- [ ] maria-eng: ticket billing-system changes for two-tier support | Due: 2026-04-29 | Dependencies: none

**Open questions**

- None on tier structure itself

---

#### Grandfathering

*Type: Decision (from agenda)*

**Discussion**

Beta users currently pay a promotional $9/mo [fictional]. Options discussed: no grandfathering (migration on launch), 6-month grandfathering, 12-month grandfathering. Alex flagged that abrupt migration would generate support volume and damage trust; sam flagged that [fictional] 12-month grandfathering costs ~$18K in foregone revenue but preserves ~340 accounts.

**Decisions made**

- **12-month grandfathering at current beta pricing ($9/mo) for existing Campaigns beta users**. rationale: preserves trust; cost is bounded; standard pm-skills pattern for paid-tier migration

**Actions**

- [ ] alex-marketing: include grandfathering in customer-comms email sequence | Due: 2026-05-01

**Open questions**

- None

---

#### Rollout date

*Type: Decision (from agenda)*

**Discussion**

Engineering timeline from maria's capacity model supports 2026-06-10 launch. Alex requested 2 weeks prior for marketing preparation. Sam confirmed telemetry setup fits the timeline.

**Decisions made**

- **Rollout date: 2026-06-10 for new customers; existing users grandfathered 2026-06-10 to 2027-06-10**. rationale: fits eng timeline, gives marketing enough runway, grandfathering end aligned to 12-month decision

**Actions**

- [ ] sam-data: set up tier-conversion telemetry in analytics | Due: 2026-05-08

**Open questions**

- None

---

#### Comms-plan ownership (emergent)

*Type: Decision (emergent. not on agenda)*

**Discussion**

Alex raised the question of who owns the customer-comms rollout sequence. Consensus: alex-marketing owns drafting; jonathan-pm owns review; sam-data provides segment lists.

**Decisions made**

- **alex-marketing owns customer-comms drafting; jonathan-pm reviews; sam-data provides segment lists**. rationale: alex has the comms background; separating drafting from review preserves bandwidth

**Actions**

- [ ] alex-marketing: draft customer-comms email sequence | Due: 2026-05-01

**Open questions**

- None
