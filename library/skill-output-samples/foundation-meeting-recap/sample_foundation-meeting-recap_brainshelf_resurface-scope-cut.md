# Sample: foundation-meeting-recap — Brainshelf Resurface Scope Cut

## Scenario

Brainshelf's Resurface team had a quick 30-minute decision meeting on 2026-04-15 to cut scope for the next sprint after a key engineer (elena-algo) flagged that a planned feature wouldn't fit Q2 capacity. Three attendees: priya-pm, elena-algo, mia-design. Small team, casual notes only (no transcript). The PM runs the recap skill with only her bullet-point notes.

# Meeting recap: Resurface Sprint Scope Cut

## Shareable summary

**Resurface Sprint Scope Cut** | 2026-04-15
Cut topic-clustered algorithm from this sprint (capacity); held recency-weighted (ships as planned).
Top actions: elena-algo: move topic-clustered to next-sprint backlog (Apr 16); mia-design: update design spec to recency-weighted only (Apr 17); priya-pm: note cut in sprint planning doc (Apr 16).
Full recap linked below.

## Full recap

### Meeting details

- **Date**: 2026-04-15
- **Actual duration**: [fictional] ~30 min (not timestamped)
- **Attendees present**: priya-pm, elena-algo, mia-design
- **Recording**: none (bullet notes only)

### Overall summary

Elena flagged earlier in the day that fitting both algorithm options into this sprint would overrun by 2 eng-days. Meeting decided to cut topic-clustered option to next sprint; ship recency-weighted this sprint. Short, focused decision meeting with no emergent topics.

### Agenda reconciliation

No prior agenda loaded (small-team ad-hoc meeting). Topic list derived from priya's notes.

### Topics

#### Scope-cut decision

*Type: Decision (inferred from discussion)*

**Discussion**

Elena walked through the capacity math: [fictional] ~3 eng-days for topic-clustered vs. 2 eng-days budget remaining in sprint. Mia confirmed design for recency-weighted is complete and ready; topic-clustered design would need one more pass. Priya weighed: shipping both this sprint risks quality; shipping only recency-weighted keeps the sprint on track.

**Decisions made**

- **Cut topic-clustered algorithm from this sprint; move to next sprint** — rationale: capacity math doesn't fit; design for topic-clustered needs one more pass anyway
- **Hold recency-weighted for this sprint; ship as planned** — rationale: design complete, capacity fits

**Actions**

- [ ] elena-algo: move topic-clustered to next sprint's backlog with full spec | Due: 2026-04-16 | Dependencies: none
- [ ] priya-pm: note the cut + reasoning in sprint planning doc | Due: 2026-04-16

**Open questions**

- None

#### Kept-scope confirmation

*Type: Information (inferred)*

**Discussion**

Quick confirmation that remaining scope (recency-weighted + related UI) is on track. Mia flagged a small UX refinement on the notification copy she wants to land before ship.

**Decisions made**

- None (confirmation of existing plan)

**Actions**

- [ ] mia-design: update design spec to reflect recency-weighted only + notification copy refinement | Due: 2026-04-17

**Open questions**

- None

### All actions (consolidated by owner)

#### elena-algo

- [ ] Move topic-clustered to next sprint's backlog with full spec | Due: 2026-04-16

#### mia-design

- [ ] Update design spec to reflect recency-weighted only + notification copy refinement | Due: 2026-04-17

#### priya-pm

- [ ] Note the cut + reasoning in sprint planning doc | Due: 2026-04-16

### Meeting quality signals

- **Outcomes achieved**: no agenda outcomes to reconcile (ad-hoc meeting)
- **Time management**: not timestamped; estimated ~30 min
- **Key attendee presence**: all three attendees present

### Next steps

- **When we reconvene**: no formal reconvene; next sprint planning on 2026-04-22
- **What needs to happen first**: elena completes backlog move; mia updates design spec
