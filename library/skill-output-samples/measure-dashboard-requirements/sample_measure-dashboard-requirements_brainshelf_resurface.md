## Scenario

Before the A/B test began, Priya M. asked Chloe B. to build the Resurface experiment dashboard in Amplitude so the team could monitor the experiment in real time and have the results analysis ready on test completion day. The dashboard needed to serve two audiences: Priya and the product team (daily monitoring during the test) and Marco S. (weekly executive check-ins requiring a single-screen summary). Chloe documented the requirements to ensure the dashboard was built once, correctly, rather than assembled ad hoc during the test window.

**Source Notes:**

- Stephen Few, "Information Dashboard Design" (perceptualedge.com) — the dashboard design principles applied in the layout specification; Few's guidance on minimizing chart junk, using small multiples for comparison, and placing the most important metric in the top-left position informed the visualization specifications.
- Amplitude, "Dashboard Best Practices" (amplitude.com/blog/analytics-dashboards) — the Amplitude-specific guidance on chart types, cohort definitions, and filter configuration used to translate the requirements into implementable specs.
- Edward Tufte, "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" (edwardtufte.com) — the data-ink ratio principle applied to the chart specifications; Tufte's emphasis on maximizing the data-to-ink ratio influenced the decision to use line charts over bar charts for time-series metrics and to avoid decorative chart elements.

## Prompt

```
/dashboard-requirements

resurface experiment dashboard for amplitude. need it ready before
the a/b test starts (mar 9).

two audiences:
1. product team (priya, chloe, alex, jordan) — daily monitoring
   during the 4-week test
2. marco (ceo) — weekly exec check-in, needs a single-screen summary

questions the dashboard should answer:
- is the treatment group returning more than control?
- are users clicking items in the digest?
- is the unsubscribe rate within the guardrail?
- what's the opt-in funnel conversion rate?
- are there segment differences (library size, cadence)?

charts i want:
1. 7-day return rate trend (treatment vs control, weekly)
2. email CTR trend (daily)
3. opt-in funnel (card viewed → opted in)
4. unsubscribe rate trend (weekly, with guardrail line)
5. segment breakdown table (library size, cadence)

filters: date range, experiment variant, library size segment.
```

## Output

# Dashboard Requirements: Resurface Experiment Dashboard

## Overview

**Dashboard Name:** Resurface Experiment (RSF-EXP-001)
**Requestor:** Priya M., Product Manager
**Date:** February 28, 2026
**Priority:** High
**Target Delivery:** March 7, 2026 (2 days before A/B test start)

---

## Purpose and Questions

### Primary Questions This Dashboard Answers

1. Is the treatment group's 7-day return rate meaningfully higher than control, and is the difference growing or shrinking over time?
2. Are opted-in users engaging with the digest content (clicking items), and is engagement stable or decaying over the test window?
3. Is the email unsubscribe rate within the 2%-per-week guardrail, or is it trending toward the threshold?
4. What is the opt-in funnel conversion rate (card viewed → opted in), and is it meeting the 10% minimum target?
5. Do segment differences (heavy vs. light savers, daily vs. 3x/week cadence) suggest that the treatment effect varies by user type?

### Decisions This Will Inform

- Ship/iterate/kill decision for the Resurface feature at experiment close (April 5, 2026)
- Whether to extend the experiment if results are directionally positive but not yet statistically significant
- Whether to pause the experiment if the unsubscribe guardrail is breached
- Whether to adjust the opt-in prompt if the opt-in rate is below the 10% target after week 1

### What This Dashboard Is NOT For

- Operational monitoring of the digest send pipeline (send failures, retry rates, Resend API health) — these are tracked in the Datadog operational dashboard, not Amplitude
- Individual user debugging ("why didn't user X receive their digest?") — use Amplitude's user timeline for individual-level investigation
- Post-experiment deep analysis (regression models, causal inference) — the dashboard provides descriptive metrics; post-experiment analysis will be done in a separate notebook

## Audience

| Audience | Usage Frequency | Primary Questions |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Priya M. (PM) | Daily during test | Return rate trend, CTR, unsubscribe rate |
| Chloe B. (Data) | Daily during test | All metrics; data quality checks |
| Alex R. (Engineering) | 2–3x/week | Send success rate, item click distribution |
| Jordan L. (Growth) | Weekly | Opt-in rate, segment differences |
| Marco S. (CEO) | Weekly (Monday exec check-in) | Single-screen summary: return rate, CTR, guardrail status |

### Usage Context

**When will this be viewed?**
Daily at 9:00 AM by Priya and Chloe (after the morning digest cycle completes). Weekly on Mondays by Marco (5-minute screen share in the exec check-in).

**What device/format?**
Desktop browser (Amplitude web app). Marco views via screen share — the dashboard must be readable at a glance on a projected screen without scrolling.

## Key Metrics

### Metric 1: 7-Day Return Rate (Primary Experiment Metric)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Business Definition** | Percentage of users who had at least one session in week N and returned for at least one session in week N+1 |
| **Calculation** | (Users with ≥1 session in week N+1) / (Users with ≥1 session in week N) × 100, computed per experiment variant |
| **Data Source** | Amplitude session events (existing instrumentation) + experiment variant assignment |
| **Granularity** | Weekly (computed each Monday for the prior 7-day window) |
| **Current Baseline** | 18% [fictional] |
| **Target** | ≥23% treatment (≥5pp lift over control) [fictional] |
| **Notes** | Intent-to-treat: all treatment users are included regardless of opt-in status |

### Metric 2: Email Click-Through Rate (Secondary Metric)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Business Definition** | Percentage of delivered digest emails where the user clicked at least one item |
| **Calculation** | (Digests with ≥1 `resurface_item_clicked` event) / (Total `resurface_digest_sent` events) × 100 |
| **Data Source** | `resurface_digest_sent` and `resurface_item_clicked` events |
| **Granularity** | Daily |
| **Current Baseline** | n/a (new metric) |
| **Target** | ≥15% [fictional] |
| **Notes** | Treatment only (control receives no email). Do NOT use open rate — Apple MPP inflates it. |

### Metric 3: Email Unsubscribe Rate (Guardrail Metric)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Business Definition** | Percentage of opted-in treatment users who unsubscribe in a given week |
| **Calculation** | (`resurface_unsubscribe` events in week N) / (Opted-in users at start of week N) × 100 |
| **Data Source** | `resurface_unsubscribe` events + `digest_enabled` user property |
| **Granularity** | Weekly |
| **Current Baseline** | n/a (new metric) |
| **Target** | ≤2% per week [fictional] |
| **Notes** | Guardrail — breaching this threshold triggers experiment pause and review |

### Metric 4: Opt-In Rate (Diagnostic Metric)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Business Definition** | Percentage of treatment users who enable the Resurface digest during the test window |
| **Calculation** | (Treatment users with `resurface_opt_in` event) / (Total treatment users) × 100 |
| **Data Source** | `resurface_opt_in` events + experiment variant assignment |
| **Granularity** | Cumulative (running total, updated daily) |
| **Current Baseline** | n/a |
| **Target** | ≥10% [fictional] |
| **Notes** | Also track the funnel: card_viewed → opted_in for conversion rate |

### Metrics Summary Table

| Metric | Definition | Source | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|--------|
| 7-day return rate | Weekly return rate by variant | Amplitude sessions | ≥23% treatment [fictional] |
| Email CTR | Daily click-through rate | `digest_sent` + `item_clicked` | ≥15% [fictional] |
| Unsubscribe rate | Weekly unsubscribe % of opted-in users | `unsubscribe` events | ≤2%/week [fictional] |
| Opt-in rate | Cumulative opt-in % of treatment users | `opt_in` events | ≥10% [fictional] |
| Saved item revisit rate | 30-day revisit rate by variant | Amplitude item events | Directional improvement |

## Data Sources

### Primary Sources

| Source | Type | Owner | Latency | Quality Notes |
|--------|------|-------|---------|---------------|
| Amplitude events (client-side) | Event stream | Chloe B. | Near real-time (~30 seconds) | Standard Amplitude SDK; no known quality issues |
| Amplitude events (server-side) | Event stream | Chloe B. | Near real-time (~30 seconds) | Fired by cron job and redirect endpoint; depends on server availability |
| Amplitude Experiment (variant assignment) | Feature flag | Chloe B. | Instant (cached client-side) | Consistent bucketing by user_id |

### Data Pipeline Requirements

**Refresh Frequency:** Near real-time (Amplitude default)
**Refresh Time:** No batch processing required; all events stream to Amplitude in real time
**Historical Data Needed:** Experiment window only (March 9 – April 5, 2026); 2-week pre-experiment baseline for return rate comparison
**Data Retention:** 12 months (standard Amplitude retention)

### Data Quality Considerations

- Apple Mail Privacy Protection inflates `resurface_digest_opened` events; the dashboard does NOT include an open rate metric for this reason
- The `item_position` property on `resurface_item_clicked` events should be validated: values must be 1–5; any values outside this range indicate an instrumentation bug
- Server-side events (`digest_sent`, `digest_skipped`) are dependent on the cron job's availability; if the cron job fails, these events will not fire, creating a data gap that must be reconciled with the Resend delivery logs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 5 charts render correctly with test data before the experiment starts (Mar 7 deadline)
- [ ] KPI cards at the top show current return rate (by variant), current CTR, and current unsubscribe rate
- [ ] Global filters (date range, variant, library size) apply correctly to all charts
- [ ] Dashboard loads in under 5 seconds on desktop
- [ ] Marco can access the dashboard in view-only mode
- [ ] Alerts fire correctly when test thresholds are breached (validated with test events)
- [ ] 2-week pre-experiment baseline for return rate is visible in Chart 1 (as a reference period before the treatment line begins)

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should the dashboard include a "days remaining" countdown or "experiment progress" indicator for the 4-week test window?
- [ ] Should Chart 1 (return rate trend) show daily or weekly granularity? Weekly is more stable but daily provides earlier signal. Current spec: weekly.
