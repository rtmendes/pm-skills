## Scenario

Storevine's growth PM and UX researcher conducted eight merchant interviews to understand why the majority of active merchants use external email marketing tools instead of Storevine's built-in email features. The interviews were commissioned after Q4 exit surveys flagged email marketing gaps as a top-three churn driver, with 22% of churned accounts citing "had to use a separate email tool" as a primary cancellation reason [fictional]. This synthesis informs the Campaigns feature scope and launch strategy.

**Source Notes:**

- Klaviyo's S-1 filing (SEC EDGAR, September 2023) reported ~130,000 paying customers at IPO, confirming Klaviyo's dominant position as the third-party email tool of choice for ecommerce merchants at scale.
- The CAN-SPAM Act (FTC, ftc.gov) mandates one-click unsubscribe and physical sender address for all commercial email — a compliance requirement merchants cited as a reason to prefer established tools over ad hoc solutions.
- Nielsen Norman Group research on small business tool adoption (nngroup.com) finds that small-business owners consistently prioritize operational continuity over optimization — a pattern visible in merchants' reluctance to migrate their email setup mid-operation.

Research topic: Why do Storevine merchants use external email tools instead
of Storevine's built-in email features?

Context: Storevine all-in-one ecommerce + web platform, ~18k active merchants
[fictional]. Q4 exit survey: 22% of churned accounts cited "had to use a
separate email tool" [fictional]. Competitive analysis filed last week.

We interviewed 8 merchants. Mix of sizes, product categories, and email tool
usage. Interview format: 45-min video call, semi-structured.

Key topics: current email tool setup, how they chose it, what they use
Storevine's built-in tools for (if anything), what would need to be true
to switch, seasonal patterns.

## Output

# Interview Synthesis: Why Merchants Use External Email Tools

## Research Overview

### Objective

To understand why Storevine merchants who are actively using third-party email marketing tools chose external tools over Storevine's built-in email features, and what would need to be true for them to consolidate onto the Storevine platform.

### Methodology

- **Format:** Video call (Zoom), semi-structured interview guide
- **Duration:** 45 minutes average; range 38–52 minutes
- **Interviewer(s):** UX Researcher (lead), Growth PM (observer/note-taker)
- **Date Range:** January 12 – January 28, 2026

### Participant Summary

| ID | Role/Segment | Store Category | Email Tool | Interview Date | Notes |
|----|--------------|----------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| P1 | Owner, ~1,200 customers [fictional] | Fashion boutique | Klaviyo | Jan 12 | Power user; 3 active flows; considered Storevine email initially |
| P2 | Owner, ~480 customers [fictional] | Home goods | Mailchimp | Jan 14 | Switched away from Storevine built-in tools 18 months ago |
| P3 | Owner, ~95 customers [fictional] | Specialty food | None | Jan 15 | Avoids email entirely; cited setup complexity as barrier |
| P4 | Owner/operator, ~2,100 customers [fictional] | Apparel | Klaviyo | Jan 19 | Most experienced email marketer in cohort; uses flows extensively |
| P5 | Owner, ~310 customers [fictional] | Beauty and skincare | Klaviyo | Jan 21 | Adopted Klaviyo after Q4 2024 peak season; regrets timing |
| P6 | Co-owner, ~60 customers [fictional] | Pet supplies | None | Jan 22 | Relies on social media; email "on the list" for this year |
| P7 | Owner, ~680 customers [fictional] | Jewelry and accessories | Mailchimp | Jan 26 | Long-time Mailchimp user from before Storevine; never evaluated switching |
| P8 | Owner, ~190 customers [fictional] | Outdoor and sporting | Storevine only | Jan 28 | Uses Storevine built-in; sends ~1 campaign/month; cites low engagement |

## Key Themes

### Theme 1: Klaviyo Dependency Creates Genuine Lock-In

**Prevalence:** 4 of 8 participants (P1, P4, P5; pattern observed in P7)

**Summary:** Merchants who adopted Klaviyo describe themselves as effectively locked in — not due to contractual commitments but because of data and workflow dependency. Their audience segments, automation flows, and historical performance benchmarks live inside Klaviyo, and the cost of migrating that institutional knowledge, not the cost of the subscription itself, is the real barrier to switching. P5 explicitly regrets her timing of adoption but says her abandoned cart flows are generating enough revenue that migration risk outweighs the potential savings.

**Evidence:**
- P1: "I've got three years of segment history in Klaviyo. My VIP segment isn't just a filter — it's a list I've cultivated. I'd lose all that if I moved."
- P4: "It's not the $200 a month. It's that I'd have to rebuild everything from scratch. My flows took me six months to tune."
- P5: "I actually wish I'd waited for Storevine to build this. But I went in right before Black Friday because I was scared of losing revenue. Now I can't leave."

### Theme 2: Storevine's Built-In Email Is Seen as "Not Real Email Marketing"

**Prevalence:** 6 of 8 participants (P1, P2, P4, P5, P7, P8)

**Summary:** Even participants who are satisfied with Storevine overall describe the built-in email tools as suitable for basic announcement sends but not for the segmentation and attribution that drives meaningful revenue. Two specific gaps recur across all six: the inability to segment audiences meaningfully by purchase behavior, and the absence of revenue attribution — knowing which emails actually drove purchases. These are not minor gaps; merchants describe them as the reason external tools exist.

**Evidence:**
- P2: "The Storevine email felt like a newsletter tool. I needed to know who bought and who didn't and send different emails to each. It couldn't do that."
- P7: "I've been on Mailchimp since 2019. I never checked if Storevine could do what I needed. It just felt like it wasn't the right tool for email."
- P8: "I use it, but honestly my open rates are bad and I don't know why. There's no way to see what's working."

### Theme 3: Fear of Disrupting Email During Peak Season Creates a Permanent "Wrong Time" Window

**Prevalence:** 5 of 8 participants (P1, P2, P4, P5, P7)

**Summary:** Merchants who would consider switching are caught in a recurring dilemma: they cannot migrate during peak season — Q4, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day — because the risk of disruption is too high, and they cannot justify the migration effort in off-season because other priorities compete for their time. P4 described this as "there's always a reason not to switch," which explains why merchants who are dissatisfied with their current tool can remain on it for years despite the cost.

**Evidence:**
- P4: "I've thought about it every January. But then February is Valentine's Day, March is spring promotions, then I'm planning for summer. There's always a reason not to switch."
- P2: "I moved from Storevine email to Mailchimp in February — my quietest month. I don't know when I'd move again. Probably never."
- P1: "If Storevine could just import my Klaviyo flows and subscriber data without me having to set it all up again, that's the only way I'd move."

## Insights

### Insight 1: The Migration Barrier Is Institutional Knowledge, Not Technical Complexity

Merchants describe switching email tools not as a technical task but as a business continuity risk. The concern is not "can I connect to a new API?" but "will my abandoned cart flow stop working during the switch, and how much revenue will I lose?" This is consistent with the Nielsen Norman Group finding that small-business owners prioritize operational continuity over optimization. A Campaigns launch strategy focused on new merchants — who have no Klaviyo history to migrate — will have meaningfully lower adoption friction than one targeting existing heavy Klaviyo users.

**Implication:** For v1 launch, target merchants with fewer than 250 customers [fictional] who have not yet adopted an external email tool. Design the Klaviyo migration path as a v2 feature after the core product is proven.

### Insight 2: Non-Adopters Are a Larger Opportunity Than Switchers

Three of eight participants (P3, P6, P8) have either no email program or a dormant one. These merchants are not locked into a competitor — they are locked out of email marketing entirely by perceived complexity. P3 explicitly cited setup intimidation as her barrier. This non-adoption segment is likely larger in the merchant base than the research sample suggests, and it is structurally easier to activate: there is no migration cost, no existing workflow to replicate, and no seasonal disruption risk to navigate.

**Implication:** The highest-ROI launch strategy may be activating non-adopters with a guided first-campaign experience rather than competing directly for Klaviyo users. Design the new-merchant onboarding flow to produce a first sent campaign in under 15 minutes.

### Insight 3: Revenue Attribution Is the Credibility Gate

Every merchant who uses a third-party tool cited revenue attribution — the ability to see which email drove which purchases — as a feature they rely on. P8, who uses Storevine's built-in tools, explicitly says she cannot tell what is working. This is not a nice-to-have feature gap; it is a credibility gap. Without attribution, merchants cannot make the business case to keep using the tool. Campaigns that ship without revenue attribution will not displace Klaviyo or Mailchimp for serious email marketers regardless of price.

**Implication:** Revenue attribution is a launch-gate requirement, not a v2 feature. If attribution cannot ship in v1, delay GA until it does.

## Recommendations

| Priority | Recommendation | Related Insight | Confidence |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | Launch targeting non-adopters and new merchants first; defer Klaviyo migration tooling to v2 | Insight 1, Insight 2 | High |
| 2 | Treat revenue attribution as a launch gate — not a post-launch addition | Insight 3 | High |
| 3 | Design a guided first-campaign flow targeting a first send in under 15 minutes for new merchants | Insight 2 | High |

### Recommendation Details

**1. Non-Adopter First Launch Strategy**

Segment the merchant base before launch into: (a) no email tool or dormant email, (b) Mailchimp users, (c) Klaviyo users. For v1, focus activation resources on segment (a) — merchants with no switching cost and the highest willingness to try something new. Develop a separate "migrate from Klaviyo" initiative for v2, with the flow import and audience migration tooling that merchants in segment (c) said is the only thing that would move them. Do not attempt a full-base activation at v1 launch; the migration burden for Klaviyo users is too high to address without dedicated tooling.

**2. Revenue Attribution as a Launch Gate**

Confirm with the engineering lead that SendGrid open and click event webhooks can be tied to purchase events in the existing order database before finalizing the GA date. If this instrumentation is not feasible within the current timeline, push GA by one sprint rather than launch without attribution. Every merchant who evaluates Campaigns after launch will ask "can I see which email drove which sale?" — without a credible answer, Campaigns cannot position above Shopify Email.

## Appendix

### Methodology Notes

Participant recruitment was conducted by the UX researcher via the Storevine merchant community forum and a merchant success team outreach to a stratified sample of accounts by customer count. All sessions were recorded with participant consent. Quotes have been lightly edited for readability; full transcripts are in the UX research repository.

### Limitations

- Sample skewed toward merchants who responded to outreach; churned merchants are underrepresented. A follow-up study with churned accounts is recommended before GA.
- The three non-adopter participants (P3, P6, P8) were recruited opportunistically; a dedicated non-adopter study with a larger sample would improve confidence in Insight 2.
- P4 is an outlier in email sophistication relative to the Storevine merchant median; findings about migration complexity may be less acute for the average merchant.
