## Scenario

Storevine's growth PM is preparing to hand the Campaigns PRD to engineering and needs to map key stakeholders before kickoff. The stakeholder set spans internal functions (engineering, design, legal, merchant success) and two external groups: a cohort of power-user merchants in the fashion and home segments who participated in discovery and have pre-launch expectations, and Klaviyo's integration partnership team, whose active merchant integration could be affected by a competing built-in tool. This analysis will inform the communication plan and risk mitigation strategy through GA launch.

**Source Notes:**

- Common B2B SaaS partner program dynamics (Shopify Partners, Stripe Partner Ecosystem, documented publicly) show that integration partners routinely respond to competing native features through reduced integration investment or public positioning against the platform . the dynamic relevant to the Klaviyo partnership risk in this document.
- The CAN-SPAM Act (FTC, ftc.gov) assigns legal compliance responsibility to the commercial email sender, not the merchant . making Legal a hard gate before any Storevine production email send, regardless of merchant consent.

## Prompt

```
/stakeholder-summary

Project: Campaigns . native email marketing for Storevine merchants
Stage: PRD complete, moving to engineering kickoff

Stakeholders I've identified:

Internal:
- Growth PM (me) . owner
- Eng Lead (Platform) . aligned, participated in PRD review
- Design . in progress on Figma specs
- Legal . needs to review CAN-SPAM + GDPR section; not started yet
- Merchant Success . launch comms owners; engaged in discovery
- Storevine Marketing . dog-food use case; interested in using
  Campaigns for our own merchant communications

External:
- Power-user merchants (fashion/home segment) . 5-6 who joined
  discovery interviews; have expectations about the feature
- Klaviyo integration partner team . active Storevine integration;
  not sure how they'll react to a native competing feature

Need: influence/interest map, stakeholder profiles, communication
plan, and risk mitigation for Klaviyo and resistant stakeholders.
```

### Quadrant Placement

**Manage Closely (High Influence, High Interest):**
- Growth PM (feature owner)
- Engineering Lead, Platform
- Merchant Success Team
- Power-user Merchants (discovery cohort; 5–6 fashion and home merchants)

**Keep Satisfied (High Influence, Low Interest):**
- Legal (CAN-SPAM/GDPR review . low day-to-day interest, but a hard launch gate with high blocking power)
- Klaviyo Integration Partner Team (influence via integration support decisions; interest is reactive, not proactive)

**Keep Informed (Low Influence, High Interest):**
- Design (execution partner; high task investment but low strategic influence on go/no-go decisions)
- Storevine Marketing (dog-food use case; wants early access; minimal launch decision influence)

**Monitor (Low Influence, Low Interest):**
- No identified stakeholders in this quadrant at this project stage.

## Detailed Stakeholder Analysis

### Engineering Lead (Platform)

**Role:** Technical lead for the Campaigns backend and API integration build; point person for the SendGrid integration, compliance architecture, and the abandoned cart event stream confirmation.
**Influence Level:** High . scope changes during the build sprint originate from or require sign-off by the engineering lead; the GA timeline is effectively controlled by this stakeholder.
**Interest Level:** High . actively participated in PRD review and authored the ADR decision on SendGrid infrastructure.
**Current Alignment:** Supportive . participated in PRD review and signed off on the scope and infrastructure decisions.

**Needs:**
- A PRD that does not change materially during the build sprint; scope creep is the primary risk this stakeholder has explicitly flagged.
- Compliance requirements from Legal before the backend data model is finalized, not after . the consent fields and suppression list architecture need to be designed in from the start.

**Concerns:**
- Legal review has not yet started; if it surfaces new data model requirements during the build, the timeline breaks. This is the highest-priority risk from the engineering lead's perspective.
- The abandoned cart event stream confirmation (platform team) is still an open item from the PRD; automation cannot be estimated until this is resolved.

**What Motivates Them:**
- Clean handoffs . clear requirements, no ambiguity on edge cases, decisions documented in ADRs so there is a single source of truth.
- Shipping on time; Q2 2026 is a high-demand sprint period and timeline slippage creates downstream staffing conflicts.

**Preferred Communication:**
- Channel: Slack (#campaigns-build) for async; weekly engineering/PM sync for decisions
- Frequency: Daily async; weekly decision-making sync
- Style: Decision-first; status plus blockers; does not want narrative progress updates

---

### Merchant Success Team

**Role:** Owner of merchant-facing launch communications, in-product announcement copy, and first-line support for Campaigns questions post-launch.
**Influence Level:** High . a poorly prepared launch communication plan or under-trained support team is a direct risk to merchant satisfaction scores and early adoption rates.
**Interest Level:** High . the Merchant Success team has been involved in discovery and is invested in Campaigns as a response to the churn signal they have been tracking.

**Needs:**
- Access to a staging environment or beta build at least two weeks before GA to prepare the team with hands-on product familiarity.
- Documentation: a written FAQ and canned support responses for the most likely merchant questions (how do I set up my first campaign? what is the free send limit? how do I import an existing email list?).

**Concerns:**
- If Campaigns launches without adequate support documentation, the team will be fielding questions they are not prepared to answer . a friction point that directly harms the merchant launch experience.
- The power-user merchants in the discovery cohort have high expectations based on interview conversations; if v1 scope falls short of what was described, Merchant Success will absorb the resulting complaints before the PM does.

**What Motivates Them:**
- Merchant satisfaction and NPS . Campaigns is positioned as a direct response to a top-three churn driver; the team wants to be able to tell that story in merchant communications credibly.
- Clear ownership: Merchant Success wants to be the launch communication owner, not a passive recipient of content produced by the PM or Marketing.

**Preferred Communication:**
- Channel: Monthly written stakeholder update; Slack for launch-week coordination
- Frequency: Monthly through T-4 weeks; weekly from T-4 weeks through GA
- Style: Merchant-impact framing; wants to understand the "why" for merchants, not just the feature spec

---

### Klaviyo Integration Partner Team

**Role:** External stakeholder; manages the active Klaviyo-Storevine integration (API sync for merchants who run both platforms simultaneously).
**Influence Level:** High . Klaviyo could reduce integration support, publicly position against Storevine, or alert shared merchants to the competitive dynamic in ways that create confusion or negative press.
**Interest Level:** Low (reactive) . Klaviyo is unlikely to proactively engage unless Storevine makes a public announcement that affects the integration relationship.
**Current Alignment:** Unknown; no direct communication has occurred with the Klaviyo partnership team about Campaigns.

**Needs:**
- Advance notice of Campaigns GA before the public announcement . not to seek approval, but to prevent the partnership team from learning about a competing native feature from a press release.
- Clarity that Campaigns v1 does not deprecate or interfere with the existing Klaviyo-Storevine integration; merchants who want to use both platforms simultaneously should continue to be able to do so.

**Concerns:**
- Campaigns positions Storevine as a Klaviyo competitor in the email marketing space, which is an awkward dynamic for a partnership team that markets the Storevine integration as a Klaviyo value-add.
- If Storevine's marketing materials frame Campaigns as a "replace Klaviyo" story, Klaviyo may respond by de-emphasizing or reducing maintenance investment in the Storevine integration.

**What Motivates Them:**
- Integration stability . Klaviyo sells the Storevine integration to its merchant base as a value-add; disruption to that integration damages their product credibility.
- Mutual merchant retention: merchants who run Klaviyo + Storevine together are higher-value accounts for both platforms; a cooperative framing preserves that arrangement.

**Preferred Communication:**
- Channel: Direct email to the Klaviyo partnership contact before GA announcement
- Frequency: One proactive notice before GA; reactive follow-up based on their response
- Style: Partnership framing; lead with "Campaigns v1 is designed for the segment of merchants who do not currently use Klaviyo" and the data supporting that (v1 lacks A/B testing, SMS, and predictive analytics that Klaviyo power users depend on)

## Key Relationships

### Dependencies

| From | To | Dependency Type |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| Engineering Lead | Legal | CAN-SPAM/GDPR data model requirements must be available before backend data model is finalized |
| Growth PM | Engineering Lead | Abandoned cart event stream confirmation (platform team) required before sprint planning |
| Merchant Success | Design | Final UI copy and error message text needed for support FAQ preparation |
| Growth PM | Klaviyo Partner Team | Pre-launch notification required before public GA announcement |

### Alliances

- **Growth PM + Merchant Success:** Aligned on churn signal and launch communication ownership; high trust from shared discovery phase involvement.
- **Engineering Lead + Growth PM:** Aligned on scope (ADR signed off); shared interest in a clean build sprint with no scope changes mid-sprint.

### Potential Conflicts

| Parties | Conflict Area | Risk Level |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Legal / Engineering Lead | Legal review surfaces new compliance requirements during the build sprint | High |
| Power-user Merchants / Campaigns v1 | Discovery interviews may have set expectations that exceed v1 scope (segmentation depth, A/B testing) | Medium |
| Klaviyo Partner Team / Storevine Marketing | Public "replace Klaviyo" messaging triggers partnership friction or reduced integration support | Medium |

## Communication Plan

| Stakeholder | Frequency | Channel | Content | Owner |
|-------------|-----------|---------|---------|-------|
| Engineering Lead | Daily async + weekly sync | Slack + meeting | Blocker resolution, scope decisions, open questions | Growth PM |
| Merchant Success | Monthly → weekly at T-4 weeks | Written update + Slack | Feature progress, support prep materials, beta access timeline | Growth PM |
| Legal | Single brief submission + one review checkpoint | Email + meeting | CAN-SPAM/GDPR requirements doc; sign-off request by T-7 days | Growth PM |
| Power-user Merchants | Beta invitation at T-3 weeks | Email (Merchant Success managed) | Beta access, scope framing, feedback request | Merchant Success |
| Klaviyo Partner Team | Once before GA | Direct email | Proactive GA notice; positioning Campaigns as complementary for small merchants | Growth PM |
| Design | Sprint cadence | Slack (#campaigns-design) | Spec questions, design QA feedback | Growth PM |
| Storevine Marketing | Monthly + beta access at T-2 weeks | Slack + email | Feature overview; dog-food access timeline | Growth PM |

## Risk Mitigation

### Resistant Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Concern | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|-------|
| Legal | Review starts late; surfaces data model requirements mid-build | Submit CAN-SPAM/GDPR requirements brief to Legal by Mar 1, 2026 . four weeks before backend build begins | Growth PM |
| Klaviyo Partner Team | GA announcement creates surprise; Klaviyo positions publicly against Storevine | Send a personal email to the Klaviyo partnership contact 48 hours before GA announcement; lead with "complementary, not a replacement" framing and v1 feature gap data | Growth PM |
| Power-user Merchants | v1 scope does not match expectations set in discovery interviews | Brief the discovery cohort via Merchant Success at beta access; explicitly acknowledge what is and is not in v1 before they use the feature | Merchant Success |

### Political Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Legal review surfaces GDPR consent requirements that change the EU merchant import flow | Could delay EU merchant access to Campaigns at GA | Scope GA as US merchants only if GDPR review is not complete by T-7; EU access as a follow-on release with no delay to US launch |
| Klaviyo publicly positions against Storevine after GA announcement | Merchant confusion about whether to keep using Klaviyo + Storevine together | Prepare a merchant-facing FAQ published at GA: "Can I use Campaigns and Klaviyo at the same time?" (Answer: Yes . the integration continues to work; Campaigns is designed for merchants not already on Klaviyo) |

## Action Items

- [ ] Submit CAN-SPAM/GDPR requirements brief to Legal by Mar 1, 2026
- [ ] Resolve abandoned cart event stream question with platform team (from PRD open questions)
- [ ] Schedule Merchant Success beta prep session at T-4 weeks (early May)
