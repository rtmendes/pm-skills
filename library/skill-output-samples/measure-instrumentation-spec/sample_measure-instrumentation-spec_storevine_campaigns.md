## Scenario

Before the Campaigns build sprint begins, Storevine's growth PM and backend engineer define the analytics instrumentation for the four events that will power the first-campaign A/B experiment and the Campaigns adoption dashboard. The spec establishes the event taxonomy, property schema, and QA validation plan used to implement and verify the instrumentation before GA.

**Source Notes:**

- Amplitude documentation (amplitude.com/docs/analytics/what-is-amplitude) . the analytics platform used for Campaigns event tracking; its tracking plan methodology and property naming conventions inform the event taxonomy in this spec.
- GDPR Article 5(1)(c) (gdpr.eu/art-5-how-to-process-personal-data/) . data minimization principle: analytics events must not collect more personal data than necessary for the specified purpose; subscriber email addresses are explicitly excluded from all event properties in this spec.
- Mixpanel, "Tracking Plan Best Practices" (mixpanel.com/blog/tracking-plan/) . establishes the naming convention standard (snake_case, verb+noun) and the tracking plan documentation format applied in this instrumentation spec.

## Prompt

```
/instrumentation-spec

Feature: Campaigns . campaign send flow + guided first-campaign flow
Analytics platform: Amplitude

Events I need to instrument:
1. campaign_created . merchant saves a campaign draft
2. campaign_sent . merchant sends a campaign
3. first_send_completed . merchant sends their FIRST campaign ever
   (milestone event for the non-adopter hypothesis)
4. attribution_recorded . a purchase is linked to a campaign click
   within the 7-day attribution window

Prior work:
- Experiment design: A/B test using first_send_completed as primary metric
- Spike summary: SendGrid webhook attribution confirmed; unique_args
  includes campaign_id, merchant_id, recipient_customer_id

PII note: Subscriber email addresses must NOT be sent to Amplitude.
Only customer_id (pseudonymous internal identifier).

Need: full instrumentation spec with event definitions, properties,
PII handling, implementation notes, and QA testing checklist.

## Output

# Instrumentation Spec: Campaigns Send Flow and First-Campaign Flow

## Overview

**Feature:** Campaigns v1 . campaign creation, send, and first-campaign guided flow

**Analytics Goals:**

1. Can we measure the first campaign send rate for non-adopter merchants within 60 days of GA . the primary metric for the A/B experiment?
2. Can we attribute revenue to specific Campaigns sends using the 7-day attribution window?
3. Can we track campaign creation and send volume to monitor adoption and identify funnel drop-off?

**Analytics Platform:** Amplitude
**Naming Convention:** snake_case, verb+noun pattern (e.g., `campaign_sent`, `attribution_recorded`)

## PII & Privacy Considerations

### PII Properties

| Property | PII Type | Handling |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Subscriber email addresses | Email | Do not send . excluded from all event properties. Only customer_id (pseudonymous) is included. |
| Campaign subject line text | Potentially sensitive (may contain merchant-specific information) | Do not send . only subject_line_length (character count) is included |
| Order value | Financial | Send as integer cents . acceptable for aggregated analytics; not PII in isolation |

### Consent Requirements

- Merchants consent to Storevine's analytics data collection through the platform Terms of Service at account creation; no additional consent is required for Campaigns analytics events.
- Subscriber (recipient) email addresses are processed by SendGrid under a separate data processing agreement and must never enter the Amplitude event stream. Only the pseudonymous `customer_id` may be used to link events across the campaign send → attribution → purchase chain.

### Data Retention

- Amplitude event data: 24-month rolling window (Amplitude Growth plan retention policy [fictional]).
- Attribution events table (Storevine database): retained for 36 months to support historical campaign performance reporting.

## Implementation Notes

### SDK/Integration

- **Platform:** Backend (server-side Amplitude SDK)
- **SDK:** Amplitude Server-Side SDK v3.x (Python) [fictional]
- **Initialization:** Amplitude client is initialized with the Campaigns service API key; events are batched and flushed every 10 seconds or at 20 events, whichever comes first [fictional]

### Event Timing

- `campaign_created` must fire at the moment the draft is first saved to the database . not at the campaign configuration step
- `campaign_sent` must fire after the SendGrid API returns a 202 Accepted response; do not fire on a network timeout or queued send without confirmation
- `first_send_completed` fires immediately after `campaign_sent` in the same request context when `is_first_send = true`; do not fire as a background task
- `attribution_recorded` fires from the webhook receiver service when the attribution chain is established; latency of up to 60 seconds after the purchase event is acceptable

## Testing Checklist

### Event Validation

- [ ] **`campaign_created`:** Create a new campaign draft in the staging environment; verify the event fires in Amplitude with all required properties present and correct; verify that subsequent edits to the same draft do NOT fire the event again
- [ ] **`campaign_sent`:** Complete and send a campaign in the staging environment with a test SendGrid API key; verify the event fires only after the 202 Accepted response is received; verify `is_first_send = true` for the first send and `false` for all subsequent sends from the same merchant
- [ ] **`first_send_completed`:** Send a campaign for the first time from a test merchant account with no prior sends; verify both `campaign_sent` and `first_send_completed` fire in the same request; verify `first_send_completed` does NOT fire on the second send from the same account
- [ ] **`attribution_recorded`:** Trigger a synthetic webhook event in the staging environment with valid `unique_args`; verify the attribution chain is established against a test order within the 7-day window and `attribution_recorded` fires with correct `order_id`, `order_value`, and `days_to_purchase`

### Property Validation

- [ ] Verify `flow_type` is `"guided"` when the merchant enters through the guided first-campaign flow and `"standard"` in all other cases
- [ ] Verify `experiment_variant` is present and set correctly for merchants enrolled in the A/B test; verify it is absent for merchants not enrolled
- [ ] Verify `order_value` is an integer (cents), not a float
- [ ] Verify `merchant_customer_count_bucket` is bucketed and not an exact count

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Verify `campaign_created` does not fire if a draft save fails due to a network error (the draft is not yet written to the database)
- [ ] Verify `attribution_recorded` does not fire if the `unique_args` payload is malformed or missing `customer_id`
- [ ] Verify events fire correctly after a session timeout and re-authentication (session ID changes; merchant_id must remain consistent)

### Debug Tools

- Amplitude event validation: use the Amplitude Data debugger (live event stream) in the Campaigns staging workspace to verify events in real time before GA
- SendGrid event log: use the SendGrid activity feed in the staging account to confirm `unique_args` values are present in the webhook payload before attributing the event in the Amplitude implementation
