# PM Skills Sample Library

126 sample outputs across 40 PM skills, organized into three narrative threads that follow fictional product teams through the full Triple Diamond lifecycle. Each sample is a complete, realistic artifact that shows what a PM team would produce when invoking a pm-skills slash command against a real product context. Utility skills have single-thread samples (storevine) demonstrating their meta-skill outputs. Meeting-family skills (foundation-meeting-*) have three samples per skill (one per thread) following the SAMPLE_CREATION.md thread standards. Certain phase skills carry additional legacy and orbit samples beyond the canonical thread trio for historical calibration.

## What Is This?

This folder contains 126 sample outputs:

- **75 canonical-thread phase-skill samples** . 3 per thread (storevine / brainshelf / workbench) × 25 phase skills
- **11 additional legacy / orbit / extra samples on select phase skills** . `discover-competitive-analysis`, `discover-interview-synthesis`, `discover-stakeholder-summary` carry 6 samples each (3 canonical + 3 legacy = 9 extras total); `deliver-prd` carries 5 samples (3 canonical + 2 orbit = 2 extras)
- **12 foundation-persona samples** . 4 variants per thread (product brief, product detailed, marketing brief, marketing detailed) × 3 threads
- **3 foundation-lean-canvas samples** . 1 per thread (companion HTML rendering files exist alongside but are not counted as separate samples)
- **7 single-thread samples** . utility skills (mermaid-diagrams, pm-skill-builder, pm-skill-iterate, pm-skill-validate, slideshow-creator, update-pm-skills) and deliver-acceptance-criteria, all storevine-only
- **15 foundation-meeting-* family samples** . 3 per skill × 5 skills (agenda, brief, recap, synthesize, stakeholder-update), one per thread
- **3 foundation-okr-writer samples** . 1 per thread (storevine, brainshelf, workbench), introduced in v2.12.0 as the first half of the OKR Skills set

75 + 11 + 12 + 3 + 7 + 15 + 3 = 126.

The samples serve two purposes:

1. **Browsability.** If you are evaluating pm-skills for the first time, you can open any sample and see the full artifact a skill produces, including the prompt that generated it.
2. **Contributor calibration.** If you are writing a new skill or modifying an existing one, these samples show the level of detail, structure, and tone that a well-executed skill output should achieve.

These are not training data, not MCP endpoints, and not API documentation. They are concrete, self-contained examples.

Authoring and maintenance rules for this library are defined in [SAMPLE_CREATION.md](SAMPLE_CREATION.md).

## The Three Narrative Threads

Every sample belongs to one of three fictional companies. Each company represents a different product type, team size, and stage of maturity. All three threads follow the same structure: a single feature arc that progresses from early discovery research through iteration and refinement, spanning all six Triple Diamond phases (Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver, Measure, Iterate).

The `foundation-persona` samples are a cross-cutting addition in `v2.5.0`: they sit outside the six phase lanes and provide story-first persona outputs for product and marketing modes.

Competitor names within samples are real. Storevine, Brainshelf, and Workbench are fictional.

| Thread | Product Type | Stage | Feature Arc | Real Competitors Referenced |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Storevine** | B2B all-in-one ecommerce platform | Series A, ~70 employees, ~15K merchants | Campaigns: built-in email/SMS re-engagement | Shopify, Squarespace, Wix, Klaviyo, Mailchimp |
| **Brainshelf** | Consumer PKM / read-later app | Post-seed, ~20 employees, ~85K registered users | Resurface: contextual morning email digest | Readwise, Raindrop.io, Omnivore, Instapaper |
| **Workbench** | Enterprise collaboration platform | Series B, ~200 employees, ~500 enterprise customers | Blueprints: doc templates with required sections and approval gates | Confluence, Notion, Coda, Monday.com |

## Why Three Different Prompt Styles?

PM teams do not all write prompts the same way. A PM at a 200-person enterprise company with a full stakeholder map and prior research artifacts writes a very different prompt than a PM at a 20-person startup who is moving fast with minimal formal documentation. The three threads deliberately model this variation so that the sample library shows realistic prompt quality across the spectrum, not just the idealized version.

**Storevine prompts are organized.** They reference prior work, include structured context, and provide clear scope boundaries. This reflects a PM who has time to prepare structured notes before invoking a skill. If you are the kind of PM who keeps a research repository and links to prior artifacts, Storevine prompts will feel familiar.

**Brainshelf prompts are rough and casual.** They provide enough context to produce a good artifact but skip the polish. Bullet points, shorthand, and incomplete sentences are common. This reflects a lean team moving fast where the PM wears multiple hats and does not have time for formal briefs. If you are shipping features in two-week sprints with a small team, Brainshelf prompts will feel familiar.

**Workbench prompts are the most complete and structured.** They include full stakeholder lists, quantified baselines, explicit metric definitions, and references to prior research. This reflects an enterprise PM who operates in a high-documentation environment where every artifact needs to withstand scrutiny from legal, compliance, and executive stakeholders. If you work in enterprise product management, Workbench prompts will feel familiar.

The skill outputs are equally thorough regardless of prompt style. The difference is in how much context the PM provides up front versus how much the skill infers or asks for.

---

## How Each Sample Is Structured

Every sample file follows a consistent three-section format:

**Scenario** (2-4 sentences) describes the company, team, and the specific PM problem that motivates the artifact. Fictional metrics carry a `[fictional]` marker. Real industry data is cited in Source Notes (3-5 bullets, public sources only).

**Prompt** contains the realistic slash command the PM typed to invoke the skill. Prompt quality varies by thread (see above). The prompt is always a fenced code block showing exactly what the PM entered.

**Output** is the complete artifact, following every section from the skill's `references/TEMPLATE.md` in order. No sections are skipped. No placeholder text remains. Every invented number carries a `[fictional]` marker.

---

## Data Integrity Rules

**`[fictional]` markers** appear on every invented metric throughout the library: conversion rates, retention percentages, user counts, NPS scores, ARR figures, and any specific number that cannot be verified from a public source. If a number does not have a `[fictional]` marker, it is sourced from a real, publicly available document cited in the Source Notes.

**Source Notes** cite real, public sources when industry context or market data anchors the scenario. All URLs are publicly accessible with no paywalls and no internal links.

**Competitor names** are real throughout. Shopify, Readwise, Confluence, Klaviyo, and their peers are named directly. Only the three thread companies (Storevine, Brainshelf, Workbench) are fictional.

## Browse by Skill

Each row links to three sample outputs for the same skill, one per thread. The foundation-persona skill has expanded coverage: 4 samples per thread (product brief, product detailed, marketing brief, marketing detailed) to demonstrate both modes at both depth levels.

### Storevine -- B2B Ecommerce Platform

Series A, ~70 employees, ~15,000 active merchants. Competes with Shopify, Squarespace, Wix, Klaviyo, and Mailchimp.

The Storevine thread follows the PM team building **Campaigns**, a built-in email and SMS re-engagement feature for merchants who currently depend on third-party tools like Klaviyo. The arc runs from merchant interviews through experiment results and a persevere decision, with prompts that reflect an organized PM who prepares structured context before invoking each skill.

### Workbench -- Enterprise Collaboration Software

Series B, ~200 employees, ~500 enterprise customers. Competes with Atlassian Confluence, Notion, Coda, Monday.com, and Basecamp.

The Workbench thread follows the PM team building **Blueprints**, reusable document templates with required sections and role-based approval gates for enterprise teams. The arc runs from team lead interviews on Confluence fatigue through a GA launch retrospective and a pivot decision to narrow focus to ops/compliance teams. Prompts are the most complete and structured in the library, reflecting an enterprise PM who operates with a full stakeholder map and quantified baselines.
