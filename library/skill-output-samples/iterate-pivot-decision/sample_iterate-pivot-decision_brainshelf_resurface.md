context: Brainshelf consumer PKM app — post-experiment persevere decision for Resurface
---

## Scenario

On April 11, 2026, Priya M. presented the Resurface A/B test results to Marco S. and the product team and formally recommended persevering — shipping the digest to all eligible users and investing in Resurface v2 improvements. The decision was framed against two alternative paths (pivot to push notifications, pivot to in-app resurfacing) to ensure the team evaluated options rather than defaulting to the status quo. Marco approved the recommendation and allocated Sprint 9 to the full rollout and v2 roadmap planning.

**Source Notes:**

- Eric Ries, "The Lean Startup" (theleanstartup.com) — the pivot-or-persevere framework applied in this document; Ries's guidance that the decision should be based on validated learning (not sunk cost or opinion) and that persevering requires the same deliberate evaluation as pivoting informed the structured options analysis.
- Andrew Chen, "The Cold Start Problem" (andrewchen.com/the-cold-start-problem/) — the network effects and growth framework referenced when evaluating the push notification pivot option; Chen's analysis of notification fatigue and user tolerance thresholds informed the risk assessment for Option 2.
- Teresa Torres, "Continuous Discovery Habits" (producttalk.org) — the opportunity solution tree methodology that connects the persevere decision back to the original opportunity tree; Torres's framework ensures that the decision to persevere is evaluated against the same outcome (7-day return rate) and opportunity (trigger gap) that motivated the initial experiment.

## Output

# Pivot Decision: Resurface — Post-Experiment Evaluation

## Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Decision Date** | April 11, 2026 |
| **Decision Maker(s)** | Marco S. (CEO), Priya M. (Product Manager) |
| **Product/Initiative** | Resurface — Morning Email Digest |
| **Time in Market** | 8 weeks (feature shipped Feb 16, 2026; A/B test ran Mar 9 – Apr 5, 2026) |
| **Investment to Date** | 1 sprint (Sprint 8, 2 weeks, 2 backend engineers + 1 frontend + 1 designer) + 4 weeks of A/B test operation |

---

## Executive Summary

**Decision:** Persevere — ship the Resurface email digest to all eligible users and invest in v2 improvements.

The 4-week A/B test produced a clear positive result: the treatment group's 7-day return rate was 23.4% [fictional] vs. 18.1% for control [fictional], a statistically significant +5.3pp lift (p = 0.008 [fictional]). All guardrail metrics passed (unsubscribe rate 1.3%/week [fictional], no app uninstall increase, no save rate decrease). The result validates the external trigger hypothesis and directly advances the Q1 retention OKR. The team will roll out the digest to all 9,800 eligible users [fictional] and begin Resurface v2 improvements (embedding-based topic matching, in-app complement, cadence experiment) in Sprint 9.

---

## Current State

### What We're Doing Now

The Resurface email digest is live behind a feature flag for 400 treatment users [fictional] in the A/B test. The feature sends a daily morning email at 7:30 AM local time with 3–5 topic-matched saved items using a TF-IDF relevance algorithm. The control group (400 users [fictional]) receives the standard Brainshelf experience with no digest.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Current (Treatment) | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------------------|--------|-----|
| 7-day return rate | 23.4% [fictional] | 25% [fictional] | −1.6pp (approaching target) |
| Email CTR | 17.2% [fictional] | ≥15% [fictional] | +2.2pp (exceeded target) |
| Unsubscribe rate (per week) | 1.3% [fictional] | ≤2% [fictional] | Within guardrail |
| Opt-in rate | 41.0% [fictional] | ≥10% [fictional] | +31pp (far exceeded target) |

### Timeline of Events

| Date | Milestone | Outcome |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Feb 16, 2026 | Resurface shipped behind feature flag | 340 UK/EU timezone bug (patched within 2 hours) [fictional] |
| Mar 2, 2026 | Opt-in enrollment begins | 41% opt-in rate by day 7 (4x target) [fictional] |
| Mar 9, 2026 | A/B test starts | First digests sent to treatment group |
| Apr 5, 2026 | A/B test ends (4 weeks) | Primary metric: +5.3pp, p = 0.008 [fictional] |
| Apr 6, 2026 | Results analyzed | Recommendation: ship |

### Resources Invested

| Resource | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Time | 8 weeks (2-week build sprint + 1 week setup + 4 weeks test + 1 week analysis) |
| Budget | ~$20/month Resend (Developer plan) [fictional]; no additional infrastructure cost |
| Team | 2 backend engineers × 2 weeks (Sprint 8); 1 frontend × 1 week; 1 designer × 1 week; 1 data analyst × 2 weeks (setup + analysis) |
| Opportunity cost | Sprint 8 could have been used for library search improvements (deferred to Sprint 10) |

## Evidence Summary

### Data That Triggered This Evaluation

1. A/B test primary metric exceeded the pre-registered success threshold: +5.3pp lift in 7-day return rate (p = 0.008 [fictional]), meeting the ≥5pp MDE
2. Email CTR of 17.2% [fictional] exceeded the 15% target, indicating that the digest content is compelling enough to drive clicks
3. Week-over-week return rate in the treatment group increased from 21.2% (week 1) to 25.1% (week 4) [fictional], showing habit formation rather than novelty decay

### Customer/User Feedback

**What Users Are Saying:**
- "This is exactly what I needed. I actually read 3 articles this week that I saved months ago." — Opted-in user, post-test survey [fictional]
- "I look forward to the morning email now. It's like someone curated my own library for me." — Opted-in user, post-test survey [fictional]
- "Some of the suggestions weren't relevant — like it surfaced a news article from October that was totally outdated." — Opted-in user, post-test survey [fictional]

**User Behavior Patterns:**
- Opted-in users clicked an average of 3.2 items per week from the digest [fictional]
- Save-only session rate dropped from 71.8% to 63.4% in treatment [fictional] — users are reading more, not just saving

### Market Signals

- Pocket (Mozilla) announced a "Resurface" feature in their February 2026 product update, validating the resurfacing concept in the read-later category [fictional]
- Readwise continues to grow in the premium PKM segment; Brainshelf's freemium resurfacing differentiates from Readwise's $8–10/month offering

### Internal Learnings

- The 41% opt-in rate [fictional] indicates much stronger latent demand for email-based features than the team anticipated; future email features (weekly summary, milestone notifications) have a larger addressable base than assumed
- TF-IDF topic matching at ~72% precision [fictional] is good enough for the MVP but leaves room for improvement — the post-test survey feedback about irrelevant items suggests that upgrading to embeddings (~84% precision [fictional]) would improve user satisfaction

## Hypothesis Review

### Original Hypotheses

| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| A daily email digest will increase 7-day return rate by ≥5pp | Validated | +5.3pp, p = 0.008 [fictional] |
| Users will opt in at ≥10% rate | Validated (exceeded) | 41% opt-in rate [fictional] |
| Email CTR will be ≥15% | Validated | 17.2% CTR [fictional] |
| Unsubscribe rate will stay ≤2%/week | Validated | 1.3%/week [fictional] |
| The return rate effect will persist (no novelty decay) | Validated (directional) | Week-over-week increase; 4 weeks is directional, not definitive |

### Key Learnings from Validation

- The external trigger hypothesis is fully validated: a daily email creates a measurable, sustained return-visit habit
- The opt-in rate finding suggests that the barrier to email features was never user resistance — it was product availability; users wanted resurfacing and had no way to get it until now
- Topic matching precision matters but is not the binding constraint in v1 — users tolerate some irrelevant items as long as the majority are good

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Persevere (Ship Digest, Iterate on V2)

**Description:** Ship the Resurface email digest to all 9,800 eligible users [fictional]. Invest Sprint 9 in v2 improvements: upgrade from TF-IDF to embedding-based topic matching, add an in-app resurfacing card as a complement (not replacement) for the email, and run a follow-up experiment on daily vs. 3x/week cadence with a larger sample.

**What Changes:** Feature flag removed; digest available to all eligible users; v2 roadmap prioritized.

**Rationale for Considering:**
- The A/B test result is unambiguous and exceeds the pre-registered success threshold
- The habit formation trend (increasing return rate over 4 weeks) suggests the effect will strengthen, not weaken, at scale
- The feature has been built, tested, and de-risked; shipping is low-cost and low-risk

**Risks:**
- The 4-week trend may not persist beyond 8–12 weeks; habit formation could plateau or reverse at scale
- Scaling from 400 to 9,800 users increases email volume from ~12K to ~290K emails/month [fictional]; deliverability at scale is untested

**Resource Requirements:** 1 sprint (Sprint 9) for rollout + v2 planning; ongoing operational cost ~$20/month Resend [fictional]

---

### Option 2: Trigger Mechanism Pivot — Push Notifications

**Description:** Replace the email digest with mobile push notifications as the primary return trigger. Instead of a morning email with 3–5 items, send a single push notification at 7:30 AM local time with the most relevant saved item and a "Read now" CTA that deep-links to the article in the Brainshelf app.

**What Changes:**
- Email digest deprecated; push notification replaces it
- Topic matching algorithm retained; selection logic changes from "pick 5" to "pick 1"
- New dependency on push notification infrastructure (Firebase Cloud Messaging for Android, APNs for iOS)

**Rationale for Considering:**
- Push notifications have higher visibility than email (notification shade vs. inbox)
- Push does not require email opt-in (uses existing app notification permission)
- Push deep-links directly into the Brainshelf app, increasing in-app session time

**Risks:**
- Push notification fatigue is a well-documented risk; daily push notifications from consumer apps have high disable rates (~40% within 30 days per industry benchmarks)
- Brainshelf's current notification permission rate is unknown — if it is low, the addressable population may be smaller than email opt-in
- Rebuilding the trigger mechanism as push requires a new sprint of development; the validated email approach is discarded

**Resource Requirements:** 1–2 sprints for push notification infrastructure + rebuild; ongoing FCM/APNs operational cost (minimal)

---

### Option 3: Surface Pivot — In-App Resurfacing Card

**Description:** Replace the email digest with an in-app resurfacing card on the Brainshelf home screen. When the user opens the app, the home screen shows a "Continue reading" card with 3–5 topic-matched saved items. No email, no push notification — the trigger depends on the user opening the app on their own.

**What Changes:**
- Email digest deprecated; in-app card replaces it
- Topic matching algorithm retained; selection logic unchanged
- No email infrastructure needed; implementation is a frontend change only

**Rationale for Considering:**
- Zero email compliance burden (no opt-in, no CAN-SPAM, no unsubscribe management)
- No deliverability risk (in-app content is always "delivered")
- Lower operational complexity than email

**Risks:**
- The in-app card only works if the user opens the app, which is the behavior we are trying to create — it cannot be the external trigger. This was the original reason Solution 1B was deprioritized in the opportunity tree.
- If users only open the app to save content (72% save-only sessions [fictional]), the card will be seen only during save sessions, not during reading-available moments
- The A/B test validated the email as the trigger mechanism; an in-app card has not been tested and has a strong structural disadvantage

**Resource Requirements:** 1 sprint for frontend implementation; no ongoing operational cost

## Analysis

### Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Definition |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Evidence strength | High | How strong is the evidence that this option will improve 7-day return rate? |
| External trigger capability | High | Does this option create an external trigger that reaches the user outside the app? |
| Team capability | Medium | Can the current team execute this option within 1–2 sprints? |
| Operational complexity | Medium | What is the ongoing operational burden? |
| Risk level | Medium | What is the likelihood of negative user impact? |

### Options Comparison

| Criterion | Persevere (Email) | Pivot to Push | Pivot to In-App |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Evidence strength | Strong (A/B validated) | None (untested) | None (untested) |
| External trigger capability | Strong (inbox) | Strong (notification shade) | Weak (requires app open) |
| Team capability | High (already built) | Medium (new infra) | High (frontend only) |
| Operational complexity | Medium (deliverability) | Low (managed services) | Low (no external dependency) |
| Risk level | Low (guardrails passed) | High (notification fatigue) | Medium (may not reach users) |
| **Overall** | **Strong** | **Moderate** | **Weak** |

## Decision

### Chosen Direction: Option 1 — Persevere

**Decision Statement:** Ship the Resurface email digest to all eligible users and invest in v2 improvements. The email digest is the validated external trigger mechanism for the re-engagement gap. The in-app card will be built as a complement (not replacement) in v2 to extend resurfacing to users who do not opt in to email.

### Rationale

The decision is straightforward: the A/B test produced the strongest positive result Brainshelf has seen on a product experiment. The +5.3pp return rate lift [fictional] is statistically significant, exceeds the pre-registered success threshold, and trends upward over the test window (habit formation, not novelty). No guardrail metric was breached. Pivoting to an untested mechanism (push or in-app) when the tested mechanism is working would be discarding validated learning to pursue speculation — the exact anti-pattern that the pivot-or-persevere framework is designed to prevent.

The in-app card (Option 3) will be built as a v2 complement because it can serve users who do not opt in to email, but it is not a replacement for the email trigger because it lacks external reach. Push notifications (Option 2) are not prioritized because the notification fatigue risk is high and the team has no data on Brainshelf's push permission rate.

### Trade-offs Accepted

| Trade-off | Impact | Why Acceptable |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Ongoing email operational complexity | Team must maintain Resend integration and monitor inbox placement | Operational cost is low ($20/month [fictional]) and the alternative (no external trigger) has a higher cost (continued retention decline) |
| ~59% of eligible users not yet opted in | Email trigger reaches only opted-in users [fictional] | In-app card (v2) will extend resurfacing to non-opted-in users; opt-in rate may continue to grow |
| TF-IDF precision ~72% [fictional] | Some users receive irrelevant items | Embedding upgrade (v2) will improve precision to ~84% [fictional]; current unsubscribe rate is comfortably below guardrail |

### Dissenting Views

No dissenting views were raised. Alex R. expressed a preference for prioritizing the embedding upgrade in Sprint 9 before scaling to all users (arguing that better relevance at scale would prevent an unsubscribe spike), but agreed with the counter-argument that the 1.3% unsubscribe rate [fictional] provides sufficient headroom to ship at TF-IDF precision and upgrade in Sprint 10.
