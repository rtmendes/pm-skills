# Sample: foundation-meeting-agenda — Storevine Campaigns Kickoff

## Scenario

Storevine is a B2B all-in-one ecommerce platform (Series A, ~70 employees, ~15K merchants). The product team is launching Campaigns, a built-in email and SMS re-engagement feature that competes with separate-tool stacks like Klaviyo or Mailchimp. The PM is running a cross-functional kickoff to commit scope, engineering capacity, and a launch target. Four attendees: jonathan (PM), maria (eng lead), alex (marketing lead), sam (data analyst). Sixty minutes. The PM has a prior research doc and a capacity model ready.

Source Notes:
- Storevine, Brainshelf, and Workbench are fictional products used consistently across this sample library
- Klaviyo and Mailchimp are real competitors; public pricing and positioning used for context
- All metrics are `[fictional]`

## Prompt

```
/meeting-agenda "Campaigns feature launch kickoff; Thursday 2pm EST; 60 min; scope, capacity, launch target. Attendees: jonathan (PM), maria (eng lead), alex (marketing lead), sam (data analyst). Pre-read: scope doc and capacity model."
