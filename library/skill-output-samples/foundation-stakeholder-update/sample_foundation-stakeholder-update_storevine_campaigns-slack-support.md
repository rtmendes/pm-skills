**🎯 Campaigns pricing decided — support playbook needed by 2026-05-15**

**TL;DR**

- Two tiers: Campaigns Starter [fictional] $19/mo, Campaigns Pro $49/mo
- Beta users grandfathered at current $9/mo for 12 months
- Rollout 2026-06-10 (new customers); migration window runs through 2027-06-10

**Context**

Product team committed pricing after yesterday's decision meeting (full recap linked below). This affects every customer who asks Support about Campaigns pricing, billing questions, or migration timing. Wanted to get this in front of you early so the playbook is ready well before launch.

**What this means for Support**

- **New questions you'll get**: "when does my $9/mo end?" (answer: 12 months grandfathered from 2026-06-10); "what's the difference between Starter and Pro?" (answer: [fictional] tier-feature matrix coming by 2026-05-08); "can I switch tiers mid-migration?" (answer: yes, with pro-rated billing)
- **Playbook additions needed**: FAQ entries for each of the above; escalation path for edge cases (multi-location merchants, annual plans, custom billing)
- **Timing**: playbook needs to be live before the first customer migration email goes out (scheduled 2026-05-22)

**❗ What I need from you**

- Update support playbook by 2026-05-15 with pricing + grandfathering flow
- Flag any customer segments we missed in the FAQ
- Confirm escalation path for complex migration cases

## Technical-to-business translation notes

**Translations applied**:

- "ARPU lift" from recap rephrased as "revenue per customer" (support audience)
- "Grandfathering" kept as-is (common term)
- "Pro-rated billing" kept as-is (support audience familiar)
- "Tier-feature matrix" link instead of inline table (support will have the matrix when it ships by 2026-05-08)

**Flagged but kept**:

- "Migration" — customer-facing but ambiguous; support team has a different meaning for this internally. If playbook gets external-facing version, use "transition" instead.
