# Sample: foundation-stakeholder-update — Workbench Blueprints Notion Update to Enterprise CS

## Scenario

Workbench's PM david-pm prepares a Notion update for the enterprise customer-success team who will onboard customers to Blueprints v1.1 after the 2026-06-15 launch. The CS team needs comprehensive documentation they can reference during customer conversations. Notion is the channel of record for enterprise CS playbooks.

Source Notes:
- Workbench is fictional
- HIPAA is a real compliance framework
- All metrics `[fictional]`

## Prompt

```
/stakeholder-update @2026-04-25_13-00EST_blueprints-v1-1-customer-feedback-review_recap.md --channel=notion --audience=customer-facing --cta="review and confirm CS playbook alignment by 2026-05-20"

# Blueprints v1.1 — Enterprise CS Briefing

**Status**: v1.1 scope decided 2026-04-25 | **Launch target**: 2026-06-15 | **Owner**: david-pm + anna-cs

---

## TL;DR

- v1.1 includes three must-fix items from customer feedback: audit-log granularity, bulk-amend flow, role-based approval shortcut
- Three themes parked to v1.2: mobile-responsive UI, exportable reports, custom status labels
- Ship target: 2026-06-15
- CS playbook needs updating before 2026-06-01 rollout

---

## What's in v1.1 (from customer-feedback must-fix triage)

### 1. Audit-log granularity

**What customers asked for**: [fictional] 5 of 6 healthcare customers flagged that the current audit log lacks "who approved what, when" granularity sufficient for HIPAA-audit compliance.

**What we're shipping**: audit log now captures approver identity, approval timestamp, pre/post-approval document state, and amendment history.

**CS talking points**:
- For healthcare customers already on Blueprints: audit-log upgrade is retroactive; they'll see v1.1 granularity for all approvals going forward (historical approvals keep v1.0 granularity)
- For prospects asking about HIPAA compliance: Blueprints v1.1 audit log meets the specific compliance requirements customers cited

### 2. Bulk-amend flow

**What customers asked for**: [fictional] 4 of 6 customers wanted to amend multiple documents in one workflow (current design only supports single-doc amendment).

**What we're shipping**: bulk-amend flow for up to 50 documents per operation; approval cascade handled per-document per approval policy.

**CS talking points**:
- Useful for quarterly policy updates and regulatory compliance cycles
- Upper limit of 50 per operation; larger batches should use the API

### 3. Role-based approval shortcut

**What customers asked for**: [fictional] 3 of 6 customers asked for automatic approval when the approver's role matches pre-configured criteria.

**What we're shipping**: role-based skip rules configurable per Blueprint template.

**CS talking points**:
- Not default-on — requires explicit configuration per template
- Intended for low-risk policy categories; customers should not enable for high-risk compliance templates

---

## What's NOT in v1.1 (parked to v1.2)

- Mobile-responsive approval UI (2 of 6 customers mentioned; lower priority)
- Exportable approval reports (2 of 6; dependency on reporting module)
- Custom approval status labels (1 of 6; edge case)

**CS talking points**: if customers ask about these, confirm they're on the v1.2 roadmap and note that specific customer interest would accelerate prioritization.

---

## Rollout timeline

- 2026-05-02: design updates complete
- 2026-05-08: HIPAA validation complete
- 2026-05-20: CS playbook locked (this is the CTA for CS team — confirm alignment by this date)
- 2026-06-01: internal dogfood
- 2026-06-15: v1.1 generally available

---

## What I need from CS

1. Review this briefing and confirm CS playbook alignment by **2026-05-20**
2. Flag any customer segments that might be surprised by what's in or out
3. Confirm the talking points above match how you'd actually explain these to customers

Post questions in #blueprints-v1-1-rollout (Slack) or comment directly on this Notion page.

## Technical-to-business translation notes

**Translations applied**:

- "Customer-cited" with specific counts retained for CS audience (they respect evidence-density)
- "Approval cascade" kept (enterprise-CS vocabulary); consider glossing if the term appears in customer-facing docs
- HIPAA named explicitly (healthcare-customer CS vocabulary)

**Flagged but kept**:

- "v1.1 / v1.2" version numbers — acceptable for CS internal briefing; replace with "this release / next release" if the doc goes customer-facing
