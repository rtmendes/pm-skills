## Scenario

Blueprints v1 launched on April 28, 2026. Two weeks later, Rachel V. facilitates the post-GA retrospective with the core Blueprints team. The launch was broadly successful: the time-to-approved metric held at 2.4 days [fictional] through the progressive rollout, and 320 of 500 enterprise accounts [fictional] have activated Blueprints. However, three issues surfaced during launch week. The approval UX confused some first-time approvers, an SSO configuration incident on day 2 blocked 12 accounts for 3 hours [fictional], and the wizard-to-canvas transition threshold (12 sections) proved too rigid for several large templates.

The retrospective covers the full journey from closed beta through GA, with a focus on identifying actionable improvements for v1.1 planning. This is the team's first retro after a major launch, and the energy in the room reflects both pride in the outcome and candor about the rough edges.

## Prompt

```
/retrospective

I'm facilitating the Blueprints post-GA retrospective. Here's the context:

**Session details:**
- Date: May 12, 2026
- Duration: 90 minutes
- Format: Virtual (Zoom), structured facilitation

**Attendees:** Rachel V. (PM, facilitator), Karen L. (Eng Lead), Tomás G. (Design Lead), Nate P. (Backend Eng), Aisha K. (Frontend Eng), Leo M. (Data Analyst), Sandra C. (Head of Product, observer)

**Context:**
- Blueprints v1 GA launched April 28, progressive rollout completed May 5
- 320/500 accounts active on Blueprints [fictional]; remaining 180 in onboarding pipeline
- Time-to-approved holding at 2.4 days [fictional] (target: ≤2.5)
- 3 launch-week incidents: (1) approval UX confusion -- 23 support tickets from first-time approvers who couldn't find the reject button, (2) SSO incident day 2 -- misconfigured SAML attribute mapping blocked 12 accounts for 3 hours, (3) wizard threshold rigidity -- 8 enterprise templates with 15+ sections couldn't use the wizard at all

**What went well:**
- A/B test methodology was solid; ship decision was data-driven and confident
- Progressive rollout caught the SSO issue at 10% before it hit all accounts
- Yjs co-editing performance exceeded targets (32ms p95 merge latency vs. 50ms target [fictional])
- Cross-functional coordination between eng, design, and marketing was the best it's been

**What to improve:**
- Approval UX needed more usability testing before launch
- SSO configuration was manual and error-prone; need automated validation
- Wizard threshold should be configurable, not hardcoded
- Edge-case doc was excellent but QA didn't have time to test all P2 scenarios

**Action items I want to formalize:** 5 items for v1.1 sprint planning

### Context

Blueprints v1 GA launched on April 28, 2026 after a 4-week A/B test (March 9 through April 5) validated the required-section enforcement hypothesis. The progressive rollout (10%, 25%, 50%, 100%) completed on May 5. As of the retrospective date (May 12), 320 of 500 enterprise accounts [fictional] have activated Blueprints, with the remaining 180 in the onboarding pipeline.

Key launch metrics at the two-week mark:
- Median time-to-approved: 2.4 days [fictional] (target: ≤2.5 days [fictional]), on target
- Empty-section submission rate: 7% [fictional] (target: ≤10% [fictional]), on target
- Monthly active Blueprint creators: 1,450 [fictional] (target: 2,000 [fictional]), tracking toward target
- Blueprint-related support tickets: 47 in first two weeks [fictional] (no alert threshold breached)

This retrospective covers the full lifecycle from closed beta through GA, with emphasis on launch-week learnings.

## Previous Retrospective Review

### Action Items from Last Retro

The previous retrospective was the post-A/B-test review (April 14, 2026). Action items and their status:

| Action item | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Remove A/B experiment flags and ship required-sections as default | Karen L. | Complete (Apr 16) |
| Finalize instrumentation spec for GA events | Leo M. | Complete (Apr 18) |
| Build post-launch monitoring dashboard | Leo M. | Complete (Apr 25) |
| Load test WebSocket provider at 500-room scale | Nate P. | Complete (Apr 20) |
| Publish IT admin provisioning guide | Rachel V. | Complete (Apr 24) |

All five action items from the previous retro were completed before GA. No carryover items. The team noted that completing all prior items before the next retro is a positive pattern worth maintaining.

## What Went Well

### Team Highlights

**Data-driven ship decision.** The A/B test methodology (account-level randomization, pre-registered MDE, Mann-Whitney U test) gave the team and leadership high confidence in the ship decision. Sandra C. noted that this was the most rigorous product decision she had seen at Workbench. The 40% reduction in time-to-approved [fictional] left no ambiguity about whether to ship. The pre-registration of the minimum detectable effect was especially valuable because it prevented post-hoc rationalization of a marginal result.

**Progressive rollout caught issues early.** The SSO attribute-mapping incident on day 2 affected only the first 10% rollout tier (approximately 50 accounts [fictional]). Because the issue was caught at 10%, the team fixed it before the 25% tier launched, preventing impact to 375 additional accounts [fictional]. The feature-flag infrastructure (LaunchDarkly) worked exactly as intended. Karen L. noted that the investment in feature flags during the Develop phase paid for itself in this single incident.

**Co-editing performance exceeded targets.** Nate P.'s Yjs implementation delivered 32ms p95 merge latency [fictional] in production, well below the 50ms target [fictional]. Zero data-loss incidents were reported during the launch period. The offline-first architecture handled three reported network-disruption scenarios without user intervention, confirming that the CRDT spike back in December was the right architectural investment.

### Process Wins

**Edge-case analysis was a lifesaver.** Karen L. credited the edge-case document with preventing at least two potential launch-blocking bugs. The "required section deleted after submission" scenario (EC-05) was caught in QA specifically because the test plan was generated from the edge-case catalogue. Without it, this would have been a day-1 production bug.

**Cross-functional coordination peaked.** Derek H.'s marketing launch (blog post, email campaign, sales enablement deck) was ready on time and aligned with the product messaging. Mei-Lin T.'s enterprise sales team had their first Blueprints-driven deal close within 10 days of GA [fictional]. The weekly cross-functional sync Rachel V. introduced during the Develop phase was cited by multiple team members as the coordination mechanism that made this possible.

### Individual Shoutouts

- **Nate P.:** Yjs integration was technically excellent and well ahead of schedule. The CRDT spike back in December set the foundation for a smooth implementation.
- **Leo M.:** The A/B test analysis and post-launch dashboard were polished and trustworthy. The team never questioned the data.
- **Aisha K.:** The wizard/canvas hybrid implementation was complex and she delivered it with zero P1 bugs.

## What to Improve

### Challenges Faced

**Approval UX confusion.** Twenty-three support tickets in the first week came from first-time approvers who could not find the reject button [fictional]. The floating action bar placed "Approve" prominently but "Reject" and "Request Changes" were behind a secondary menu. Tomás G. acknowledged this was a design trade-off to emphasize the positive action, but it backfired with users who needed to reject. The approval flow is a critical workflow for compliance-oriented customers, and any friction here undermines the value proposition of governance-ready Blueprints.

**SSO attribute-mapping incident.** On day 2 (April 29), 12 enterprise accounts [fictional] were blocked from accessing Blueprints for approximately 3 hours due to a misconfigured SAML attribute mapping. The root cause was a manual configuration step in the SSO provisioning process that was not validated automatically. The IT admin provisioning guide documented the correct mapping, but 12 accounts had already been provisioned before the guide was published. Nate P. noted that the 3-hour resolution time was acceptable but could have been 30 minutes with automated detection.

**Wizard threshold rigidity.** Eight enterprise customers reported that their templates with 15 or more sections [fictional] could not use the guided wizard at all, because the hardcoded 12-section threshold automatically disabled it. These customers wanted the wizard for onboarding new team members to complex templates, which is exactly the scenario where guided step-by-step creation is most valuable. The hardcoded threshold made sense as an initial default but should have been configurable from the start.

### Process Pain Points

**QA coverage gap on P2 scenarios.** The edge-case document included 11 P2 test scenarios, but QA only completed 7 of them before launch [fictional]. The four untested P2 scenarios included the "prolonged offline merge" case (EC-10), which has not yet caused a production issue but remains a risk. The team agreed that insufficient QA capacity for the scope of the launch was a planning gap, not a QA team failure.

**Monitoring dashboard was ready just 3 days before launch.** Leo M. completed the dashboard on April 25, leaving only 3 days for the team to familiarize themselves with it before launch. Earlier delivery would have allowed the team to practice monitoring workflows and catch dashboard bugs (one filter did not work correctly on launch day).

### Themes Identified

1. **Usability testing gaps for non-primary personas.** The approval UX was tested with authors (primary persona) but not thoroughly with approvers (secondary persona). This is a pattern: secondary personas get less design and testing attention.
2. **Manual configuration is a reliability risk.** The SSO incident was caused by a manual step. Anywhere the system relies on a human to configure something correctly without automated validation is a latent incident waiting to happen.
3. **Hardcoded thresholds don't serve enterprise customers.** Enterprise customers have diverse needs. Fixed thresholds (like the 12-section wizard limit) should be configurable by admins wherever possible.

## Discussion Notes

### Topic 1: Approval UX Redesign Priority

The team discussed whether the approval UX should be redesigned before v1.1 or addressed as a quick fix. Tomás G. proposed promoting the Reject and Request Changes buttons to the primary action bar (equal visual weight with Approve). Karen L. estimated 2 story points for the change. Rachel V. confirmed this should be the first item in the v1.1 sprint. Sandra C. agreed that 23 support tickets in week 1 [fictional] is a strong signal that warrants immediate action, and added that Mei-Lin T. had received direct feedback from two enterprise prospects about the approval flow.

**Decision:** Approval UX fix is the highest-priority item for v1.1 Sprint 1.

### Topic 2: SSO Provisioning Automation

Nate P. proposed building an automated SAML attribute validation step that runs during account provisioning and flags misconfigurations before they block users. Karen L. estimated 5 story points. The team agreed this is important but less urgent than the approval UX fix because the IT admin guide now covers the correct configuration and no new incidents have occurred since the guide was published. The automation would prevent future incidents as Workbench onboards the remaining 180 accounts in the pipeline.

**Decision:** SSO validation automation is a v1.1 Sprint 1 item, lower priority than the approval UX fix.

## Action Items

### Action Item Details

| ID | Action | Owner | Priority | Target date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AI-01 | Redesign approval action bar: promote Reject and Request Changes to primary visibility | Tomás G. / Aisha K. | P1 | May 26, 2026 | 2 story points; design + implementation |
| AI-02 | Build automated SAML attribute validation during account provisioning | Nate P. | P2 | Jun 9, 2026 | 5 story points; prevents repeat of day-2 incident |
| AI-03 | Make wizard section threshold configurable by template admins (default: 12) | Aisha K. | P2 | Jun 9, 2026 | 3 story points; addresses 8 enterprise customer reports |
| AI-04 | Complete remaining 4 untested P2 edge-case scenarios | QA | P2 | May 26, 2026 | Prioritize EC-10 (prolonged offline merge) |
| AI-05 | Establish a "secondary persona usability review" gate for future launches | Tomás G. / Rachel V. | P3 | Jun 23, 2026 | Process improvement; add to launch checklist template |

## Parking Lot

The following topics were raised but deferred to future discussions:

- **Version history UI (v1.1 scope):** Karen L. asked whether version history should show CRDT state diffs or human-readable content diffs. Deferred to v1.1 design review (scheduled for May 19).
- **Confluence migration tooling:** Mei-Lin T. reported that 15 enterprise prospects [fictional] want an automated Confluence-to-Blueprints migration tool. Deferred to product strategy review (June).
- **Template marketplace timeline:** Sandra C. asked about the v2 template marketplace roadmap. Deferred to quarterly planning (July).

## Metrics and Trends

### Team Health Indicators

| Indicator | Rating (1-5) | Trend vs. last retro |
|---|---|---|
| Team morale | 4.3 [fictional] | Up (was 3.8 [fictional]) |
| Confidence in process | 4.1 [fictional] | Up (was 3.5 [fictional]) |
| Cross-functional communication | 4.5 [fictional] | Up (was 4.0 [fictional]) |
| Workload sustainability | 3.4 [fictional] | Down (was 3.7 [fictional]) |
| Clarity of priorities | 4.2 [fictional] | Stable |

Team morale and confidence are at their highest levels since the Blueprints project began. The successful launch and strong metrics validated the team's work over the past six months. Workload sustainability dipped slightly due to launch-week on-call intensity; the team flagged the need for a lighter sprint immediately post-launch. Rachel V. committed to scheduling a "cool-down" sprint with reduced scope before the v1.1 push begins.

### Recurring Themes

| Theme | Occurrences | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Secondary persona usability gaps | 2nd retro in a row | Action item AI-05 created |
| Manual configuration risks | New | Action item AI-02 created |
| Enterprise configurability needs | 2nd retro in a row | Action item AI-03 created |
| QA coverage pressure | 3rd retro in a row | Ongoing; team to discuss QA capacity in v1.1 planning |

## Facilitator Notes

The session ran 85 of the 90 allocated minutes. Participation was strong across all team members. Sandra C.'s presence as an observer did not appear to constrain candor: the team raised the SSO incident and QA coverage gap openly. The "What Went Well" section generated more energy than usual, reflecting genuine pride in the launch outcome.

One facilitation adjustment for next time: allocate more time for Discussion Notes. The approval UX and SSO topics consumed 30 minutes, leaving limited time for the wizard threshold discussion, which was resolved quickly but could have benefited from more exploration. Rachel V. plans to timebox each discussion topic at 12 minutes in the next session.
