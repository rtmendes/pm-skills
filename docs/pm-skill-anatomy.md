# PM-Skill Anatomy

A practical guide to how skills are structured in the pm-skills repository. For the spec-level, cross-platform reference, see [Agent Skill Anatomy](./agent-skill-anatomy.md).

## Directory Structure

Every skill lives in a flat directory under `skills/`:

```
skills/
├── deliver-prd/                    # Domain skill (phase prefix)
│   ├── SKILL.md                    # Instructions
│   └── references/
│       ├── TEMPLATE.md             # Output format
│       └── EXAMPLE.md              # Completed example
├── foundation-persona/             # Foundation skill (classification prefix)
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── references/
│       ├── TEMPLATE.md
│       └── EXAMPLE.md
└── utility-pm-skill-builder/       # Utility skill (classification prefix)
    ├── SKILL.md
    └── references/
        ├── TEMPLATE.md
        └── EXAMPLE.md
```

Directory names follow the pattern `{prefix}-{skill-name}` where the prefix is the phase (for domain skills) or classification (for foundation/utility skills).

## The Three Files

### SKILL.md — The Instructions

The core file. Contains frontmatter metadata and markdown instructions that tell an AI agent how to produce an artifact. Structure:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Frontmatter | Machine-readable metadata (name, description, phase/classification, version) |
| Title + intro | What this skill produces and why it matters |
| When to Use | Trigger conditions (3-5 bullets) |
| Instructions | Numbered steps the agent follows |
| Output Contract | References `references/TEMPLATE.md` as the output format |
| Quality Checklist | Verification criteria before finalizing |
| Examples | References `references/EXAMPLE.md` |

### TEMPLATE.md — The Output Format

Defines the structure of what the skill produces. Contains section headers with guidance comments explaining what goes in each section. The agent fills this template when executing the skill.

CI requirement: must contain at least 3 `##` sections.

### EXAMPLE.md — The Quality Benchmark

A complete, realistic example of the skill's output. Shows what "good" looks like — not an outline or placeholder, but a fully filled artifact (typically 150-300 lines for complex skills).

---

## Classification Types

Skills are classified into three types that determine their directory naming and frontmatter:

### Domain Skills (25)

Phase-specific PM activities organized by the Triple Diamond framework.

- **Directory**: `{phase}-{skill-name}` (e.g., `deliver-prd`)
- **Frontmatter**: `phase: deliver` (required), no `classification` field
- **Phases**: discover, define, develop, deliver, measure, iterate

### Foundation Skills (1)

Cross-cutting capabilities that apply across multiple phases.

- **Directory**: `foundation-{skill-name}` (e.g., `foundation-persona`)
- **Frontmatter**: `classification: foundation` (required), no `phase` field
- **Use when**: the skill applies to multiple phases equally

### Utility Skills (1)

Meta-skills that operate on the repository, workflow, or other skills.

- **Directory**: `utility-{skill-name}` (e.g., `utility-pm-skill-builder`)
- **Frontmatter**: `classification: utility` (required), no `phase` field
- **Use when**: the skill creates, validates, or manages other skills

---

## Frontmatter

Every SKILL.md begins with an HTML comment and YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
<!-- PM-Skills | https://github.com/product-on-purpose/pm-skills | Apache 2.0 -->
---
name: deliver-prd
description: Creates a comprehensive Product Requirements Document...
phase: deliver
version: "2.0.0"
updated: 2026-01-26
license: Apache-2.0
metadata:
  category: specification
  frameworks: [triple-diamond, lean-startup, design-thinking]
  author: product-on-purpose
---
```

**Required fields**: `name`, `description`, `version`, `updated`, `license`

**Classification fields** (mutually exclusive):
- Domain skills: `phase:` (one of 6 phases)
- Foundation/utility skills: `classification:` (foundation or utility)

**Key rules**:
- `name` must exactly match the directory name
- `description` must be 20-100 words on a single line (no `>-` or `|` folding)
- `version` must be quoted and appear exactly once at the root level (no `metadata.version`)

For the full schema, see [frontmatter-schema.yaml](./reference/frontmatter-schema.yaml).

## The Triple Diamond

PM-skills organizes domain skills across 6 phases of the Triple Diamond framework:

```
    DISCOVER          DEFINE          DEVELOP

```

| Phase | Skills | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Discover | 3 | Research, competitive analysis, stakeholder mapping |
| Define | 4 | Problem framing, hypotheses, opportunity trees, JTBD |
| Develop | 4 | Solution briefs, ADRs, design rationale, spikes |
| Deliver | 6 | PRDs, user stories, acceptance criteria, edge cases, launch, release notes |
| Measure | 4 | Experiments, instrumentation, dashboards, results |
| Iterate | 4 | Retrospectives, lessons, refinement, pivot decisions |

Foundation and utility skills sit outside the phase model — they serve all phases or operate at a meta level.

## The Wiring Layer

Skills don't work in isolation. Three mechanisms connect them to users and agents:

### Commands (`commands/*.md`)

Slash commands that invoke skills. Each command file has `description:` frontmatter and a prose body that tells the agent which skill to read and follow.

```
commands/prd.md          → invokes skills/deliver-prd/SKILL.md
commands/persona.md      → invokes skills/foundation-persona/SKILL.md
commands/pm-skill-builder.md → invokes skills/utility-pm-skill-builder/SKILL.md
```

### AGENTS.md

The discovery file for AI agents. Lists all registered skills with paths and descriptions, organized by phase/classification. Agents scan this file to find the right skill for a task.

Sections: Foundation Classification, Discover Phase, ..., Iterate Phase, Utility Skills, Workflow Bundles, Commands.

### Bundles (`_bundles/*.md`)

Multi-skill workflows that chain skills together. Three shipped bundles:
- **Triple Diamond** — Complete product development cycle
- **Lean Startup** — Build-Measure-Learn rapid iteration
- **Feature Kickoff** — Quick-start workflow (problem → hypothesis → PRD → stories)

---

## CI Validation

Four scripts validate skill integrity:

| Script | What it checks |
|--------|---------------|
| `lint-skills-frontmatter` | Frontmatter fields, description word count, phase/classification consistency, TEMPLATE.md structure, EXAMPLE.md existence |
| `validate-agents-md` | AGENTS.md paths match actual skill directories |
| `validate-commands` | Command files reference valid skill paths |
| `check-mcp-impact` | Advisory — detects skill additions/renames that may affect the MCP server |

Run all validators before committing new skills:

```bash
bash scripts/lint-skills-frontmatter.sh
bash scripts/validate-agents-md.sh
bash scripts/validate-commands.sh
bash scripts/check-mcp-impact.sh
```

PowerShell equivalents: replace `bash scripts/` with `pwsh -File scripts/` and `.sh` with `.ps1`.

## Creating a New Skill

Use `/pm-skill-builder` to create new skills interactively. The builder:

1. Understands your skill idea (problem-first or skill-first entry)
2. Runs gap analysis against all existing skills
3. Validates through a Why Gate (if overlap found)
4. Classifies by type and phase, selects exemplar skills to model
5. Generates a Skill Implementation Packet with draft files
6. Writes drafts to `_staging/pm-skill-builder/{skill-name}/` (gitignored)
7. On confirmation, promotes to canonical locations and validates

### Staging and Promotion

Draft files are written to a gitignored staging area before promotion:

```
_staging/pm-skill-builder/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md               → skills/{dir-name}/SKILL.md
├── references/
│   ├── TEMPLATE.md        → skills/{dir-name}/references/TEMPLATE.md
│   └── EXAMPLE.md         → skills/{dir-name}/references/EXAMPLE.md
└── command.md             → commands/{command-name}.md
```

Promotion copies each file to its canonical location, appends the AGENTS.md entry, runs CI validators, and deletes the staging folder on success. If validation fails, staging is preserved for fixes.

For manual creation, follow the structure in [skill template](./templates/skill-template/) and validate with the CI scripts above.
