# Category Taxonomy

Categories represent **framework-agnostic PM activities**. They enable skills to be mapped to any methodology (Triple Diamond, Lean Startup, Design Thinking, etc.) through a common vocabulary.

## Overview

### Why Categories?

Product management methodologies use different terminology for similar activities:
- Triple Diamond calls it "Discover" → we call it `research`
- Lean Startup calls it "Customer Development" → we call it `research`
- Design Thinking calls it "Empathize" → we call it `research`

Categories provide a **neutral abstraction layer** that lets skills work across methodologies without being tied to any specific framework's vocabulary.

They are also **orthogonal to classification**. Domain, foundation, and utility skills can all use the same `metadata.category` taxonomy.

### How Categories Work

**When to use research skills:**
- Starting a new initiative and need to understand the problem space
- Evaluating market opportunities or competitive threats
- Onboarding to a new product area
- Building alignment with stakeholders before major decisions

**Common workflow:**
```
stakeholder-summary → interview-synthesis → competitive-analysis
     (who)               (users)              (market)
```

**When to use ideation skills:**
- After problem framing, before committing to a solution
- When multiple valid approaches exist
- Pitching a solution approach to stakeholders
- Designing experiments to test assumptions

**Common workflow:**
```
hypothesis → solution-brief
  (if/then)    (how)
```

---

### specification

| `design-rationale` | Documents the reasoning behind design decisions including alternatives considered |

**When to use specification skills:**
- After solution alignment, before engineering begins

- Making significant technical or design decisions
- Ensuring comprehensive test coverage

**Common workflow:**
```
prd → user-stories → edge-cases
       ↓
      adr (if technical decisions needed)
       ↓
   design-rationale (if UX decisions needed)
```

### validation

> Testing assumptions with data

**Purpose:** Design and instrument experiments to validate hypotheses with real data. Validation activities ensure teams measure what matters and can draw valid conclusions.

**Activities:**
- Experiment design (A/B tests)
- Analytics instrumentation
- Dashboard specification
- Measurement planning
- Sample size calculation

**Skills (3):**

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|

**When to use validation skills:**
- Before launching an A/B test
- When implementing new features that need tracking
- Requesting dashboards from data teams

**Common workflow:**
```
experiment-results → pivot-decision (if needed)
        ↓
  retrospective → lessons-log
```
