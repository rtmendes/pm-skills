# PM Skills

**38 best-practice product management skills for AI agents.**

PM Skills teaches AI assistants how to produce professional PM artifacts - PRDs, user stories, acceptance criteria, experiment designs, and more. One command, consistent output, every time.

## The Triple Diamond

Skills are organized across 6 phases of the Triple Diamond framework - three diamonds covering the problem space, the solution space, and the learning space.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Problem Space"
        D1["Discover<br/>3 skills"] --> D2["Define<br/>4 skills"]
    end
    subgraph "Solution Space"
        D3["Develop<br/>4 skills"] --> D4["Deliver<br/>6 skills"]
    end
    subgraph "Learning Space"
        D5["Measure<br/>4 skills"] --> D6["Iterate<br/>4 skills"]
    end
    D2 --> D3
    D4 --> D5
    D6 -.->|"next cycle"| D1
```

## The Skill Lifecycle

Three utility skills form a self-reinforcing quality loop for managing the skill library itself:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Create["/pm-skill-builder<br/>Create"] --> Validate["/pm-skill-validate<br/>Validate"]
    Validate --> Decision{Findings?}
    Decision -- "PASS" --> Ship["Ship"]
    Decision -- "WARN / FAIL" --> Iterate["/pm-skill-iterate<br/>Iterate"]
    Iterate --> Validate
```

**Create** a new skill with guided gap analysis and classification. **Validate** it against structural conventions and quality criteria. **Iterate** to fix findings from the validation report or apply feedback. Repeat until passing, then ship.

The lifecycle tools are what keep the library consistent as it grows - the validator catches drift, and the iterator applies fixes with version tracking and change summaries.

[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more about the lifecycle](concepts/skill-lifecycle.md) · [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Skill versioning](concepts/versioning.md)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/product-on-purpose/pm-skills.git
cd pm-skills
```

Then use any skill:

```
/prd "Search feature for e-commerce platform"
/hypothesis "Will one-page checkout increase conversion?"
/acceptance-criteria "User can reset password via email"
```
