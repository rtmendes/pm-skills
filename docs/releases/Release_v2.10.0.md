# Release v2.10.0 — Utility & Skill Expansion

**Status:** Final
**Date:** 2026-04-11

## Highlights

- 3 new utility skills: mermaid diagrams, slideshow creation, self-updater
- Self-updater lets users check for and apply pm-skills updates from a single command
- MCP server decoupled from release cycle (frozen until team adoption warrants it)
- Codex cross-LLM review validated release plan and feature design

> **Note:** F-16 (mermaid-diagrams) and F-19 (slideshow-creator) content has
> been available since v2.9.1 but is formally released and documented with
> v2.10.0 as the utility skill expansion release.

## New Skills

### utility-mermaid-diagrams (F-16)

Teaching PMs to create syntactically valid mermaid diagrams. 15 diagram
types with dual-lens navigation (type catalog + PM use-case guide),
dedicated syntax validity reference, planning worksheet, and worked
examples.

**Invoke:** `/mermaid-diagrams "diagram description"`

### utility-slideshow-creator (F-19)

Generate professional presentations (.pptx and PDF) from JSON deck
specifications. 18 slide types with dark/light variants, content-to-layout
decision logic, calibrated character limits, Google Slides compatibility.

**Invoke:** `/slideshow-creator "presentation brief"`

### utility-update-pm-skills (F-24)

Check for updates, preview changes, and update your local pm-skills
installation. Three modes:

| Mode | Command | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Status check | `/update-pm-skills --status` | Quick version comparison |
| Preview | `/update-pm-skills --report-only` | See what would change without writing files |
| Full update | `/update-pm-skills` | Download, confirm, backup, update, report |

Key features:
- Validated-before-copy safety (downloads to temp, validates, then copies)
- Optional backup before overwriting (`_pm-skills/backups/`)
- Value-delta reports showing what's new and what it enables
- Post-update smoke test (version consistency, file integrity, skill count)
- Degraded mode with manual instructions when offline
- FAQ for common questions

**Guide:** [Updating PM Skills](../guides/updating-pm-skills.md)

## Changed

- Repo now ships **32 skills** (25 phase + 1 foundation + 6 utility),
  **39 commands**, and **10 workflows**
- `_pm-skills/` directory convention added to `.gitignore` (local state
  for update reports and backups)
- MCP server decoupled from release cycle (M-22) — pm-skills-mcp is
  frozen and no longer a release prerequisite

## Sample Library

7 new sample outputs added for skills that were missing from the sample
library. All use the storevine thread (Campaigns feature):

- **deliver-acceptance-criteria** — Given/When/Then ACs for the email template builder
- **utility-mermaid-diagrams** — flowchart planning worksheet for campaign send approval
- **utility-slideshow-creator** — JSON deck spec for a campaigns launch presentation
- **utility-pm-skill-builder** — skill implementation packet for a fictional campaign-analytics skill
- **utility-pm-skill-validate** — validation report with 2 findings
- **utility-pm-skill-iterate** — iteration applying the validation findings
- **utility-update-pm-skills** — update completion report (v2.9.1 → v2.10.0)

Sample library: **84 → 91 samples**, now covering all 32 skills.

Generated `docs/skills/` pages for all 3 new utility skills (mermaid-diagrams,
slideshow-creator, update-pm-skills).

## Infrastructure

- Codex cross-LLM review completed: 1 Blocker, 12 Major, 11 Minor
  findings — all resolved before release
- v2.9.1 shipped as a prerequisite (workflows guide, count consistency CI)
