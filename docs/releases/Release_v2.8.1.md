## Executive Summary

v2.8.1 launches the **PM Skills documentation site** at [product-on-purpose.github.io/pm-skills](https://product-on-purpose.github.io/pm-skills/). Built with MkDocs Material, the site provides a searchable, navigable, mobile-friendly interface to the entire PM Skills library — including 29 skill pages, 3 interactive "Follow the Product" showcase journeys with 84 real sample outputs, workflow recipes, a skill finder, prompt gallery, and skill comparisons.

- **84 real-world samples** embedded from the sample library across 3 narrative arcs
- **7 workflow recipes** with mermaid flow diagrams
- **6 skill comparisons** for commonly confused pairs

## What's New

### Documentation Site

The site at `product-on-purpose.github.io/pm-skills/` features:

- **MkDocs Material** with dark/light mode, tab navigation, full-text search, and mermaid diagram rendering
- **Auto-deployment** via GitHub Actions on every push to main
- **Social cards** for rich link previews when sharing on Slack/LinkedIn

### Showcase: Follow the Product

Three interactive story pages where readers follow a fictional company through the complete PM lifecycle — from discovery research to pivot decisions. Each step shows the actual prompt and the full artifact output.

- **Storevine** (B2B ecommerce) — organized prompt style
- **Brainshelf** (consumer PKM app) — casual prompt style
- **Workbench** (enterprise collaboration) — structured prompt style

### Skill Pages Enhanced

Every skill page now includes:
- Quick-try slash command snippet at the top
- Real-world examples from 3 product contexts (collapsible)
- Phase flow diagrams showing how skills connect

### New Guide Pages

- **Skill Finder** — interactive decision tree for choosing the right skill
- **Recipes** — 7 end-to-end workflows (Pitch a Feature, Run an Experiment, etc.)
- **Prompt Gallery** — curated prompts in 3 styles with commentary
- **Skill Comparisons** — PRD vs Solution Brief, Hypothesis vs Problem Statement, etc.
- **MCP Setup** — user-facing guide for installing and using pm-skills-mcp

### Generation Scripts

Two Python scripts keep the site in sync with skill source files:
- `scripts/generate-skill-pages.py` — generates 29 skill pages + phase indexes + commands reference
- `scripts/generate-showcase.py` — generates 3 showcase journeys from the sample library

---

## Infrastructure

- `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` — automated deployment on push
- `mkdocs.yml` — site configuration with Material theme, plugins (search, privacy, social, tags), and full nav tree
- `requirements-docs.txt` — Python dependencies (mkdocs-material, pillow, cairosvg)

---

## No MCP Impact

No skills were added, renamed, or changed. `pm-skills-mcp` v2.8.0 remains current.
