# Brainshelf: Follow the Product

> Post-seed, ~20 employees, ~22,000 MAU. Building **Resurface** . contextual morning email digest.
>
> **Prompt style:** Casual . rough, fast, enough context to work. Bullet points and shorthand.

## Phase: Foundation

### Lean Canvas

*Brainshelf Resurface one-page thesis for pre-scope sanity check and the Friday board-update anchor, framing the Monday-morning digest bet against the flat long-tail-retention baseline*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```text
    /lean-canvas

    quick lean canvas for Resurface (morning email digest of saved stuff).

    context:
    - brainshelf post-seed, 85k users, retention flat
    - users with 3+ saves/wk have 3.4x retention and 2.1 referrals/quarter [fictional]
    - hypothesis: send saved items back to them monday mornings
    - competitors in the space: Readwise Reader, Raindrop, Omnivore, Pocket
    - need a one-pager for board update friday and to scope v1

    content mode is fine. be honest about what we don't know.
    ```

### Persona (Marketing Brief)

*Brainshelf marketing persona for newsletter-creator acquisition and content-curation positioning*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```text
    /persona marketing brief

    marketing persona for newsletter creator acquisition channel.

    context: brainshelf users who share 3+ items/week have 3.4x retention
    and 2.1 referral signups/quarter [fictional]. newsletter creators are
    a natural fit because they already curate. want a persona for
    acquisition messaging and potential "Curator" tier positioning.

    competitors in this space: Readwise Reader, Raindrop, Pocket.
    keep it brief but actionable for growth experiments.

### Persona (Marketing Detailed)

*Brainshelf Resurface marketing persona for freemium-to-paid conversion strategy and subscription messaging*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```text
    /persona marketing detailed

    need a marketing persona for the Resurface premium conversion funnel.

    context: brainshelf is prepping the freemium-to-paid strategy for
    Resurface. free users can see 3 resurfaced items per week but premium
    unlocks unlimited plus custom filters. want a persona to drive paywall
    copy, trial-to-paid nurture, and acquisition messaging.

    key concern: user research shows 4/7 interviewees said they've abandoned
    paid productivity tools before. subscription fatigue is the real
    competitor, not Readwise.

    28% of free users hit the weekly limit at least once [fictional]
    but only 4% convert within 30 days [fictional]

    include trigger events, objections, messaging architecture, and
    evidence trail.

### Persona (Product Brief)

*Brainshelf Resurface activation persona for early-retention product decisions*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```text
    /persona product brief

    Need a concise story-first product persona for Brainshelf Resurface activation work.

    Context:
    - Product: Brainshelf (consumer PKM app)
    - Feature: Resurface morning digest and revisit flow
    - Problem: users open first digest, but many do not form repeat revisit behavior
    - Downstream artifacts: hypothesis revision, user stories, edge-cases

    Please include:
    - clear decision posture and tradeoff lens
    - includes/excludes boundaries
    - scenario tailoring for hypothesis, user stories, edge-cases
    - assumptions/confidence/evidence trail
    ```

### Persona (Product Detailed)

*Brainshelf Resurface product persona for power-curator workflows and advanced resurfacing customization*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```text
    /persona product detailed

    detailed persona for Brainshelf Resurface power curator segment.

    context: we're scoping resurface v1.1 and the power curators are a
    different animal from casual users. they save 80+ items/month [fictional],
    use tags and folders, and their mental model of their library is
    structured. the current relevance algorithm doesn't respect their
    curation choices.

    7% of MAU, 42% of shares [fictional]. they're the word-of-mouth engine.

    need this for PRD scoping, user stories, and edge cases around topic
    filters, curation-aware relevance, and search within resurface.

    include full decision model, workflow friction, and evidence trail.

### Competitive Analysis

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . competitive landscape for content resurfacing features*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /competitive-analysis

    pkm and read-later market, focusing on resurfacing and re-engagement
    features. brainshelf is planning a resurface feature (morning email digest
    with 3-5 saved items) and need to understand the competitive landscape.

    context: brainshelf is a consumer pkm/save-for-later tool, ~85k registered
    users, ~22k MAU [fictional]. core problem is users save tons of stuff but
    never come back to read it . 47 items saved/month, <9% revisited within
    30 days [fictional].

    4 competitors to analyze: readwise, raindrop.io, pocket (mozilla),
    instapaper. focus on resurfacing features, email digests, pricing,
    and where the white space is for us.

### Interview Synthesis

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . user interviews on saved content re-engagement*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /interview-synthesis

    ran 7 user interviews over the past 2 weeks about why people save stuff
    to brainshelf but never go back to read it. need to synthesize the findings.

    interviews were video calls, 30-45 min each. mix of heavy savers,
    occasional users, and one churned user.

    main findings:
    - 5/7 described their library negatively ("guilt pile", "overwhelming", etc)
    - nobody has a natural trigger to go back and read saved stuff
    - there's a weird split between "saving to read later" and "saving to have"
      that people don't realize until you ask them

    some great quotes. need this formatted for the team before we start
    building the hypothesis doc for resurface.

### Stakeholder Summary

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . internal stakeholder map for the Resurface feature*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /stakeholder-summary

    need to map the internal stakeholders for the resurface feature before
    we kick off the build. brainshelf is a ~20 person startup so this is
    small-team politics, not enterprise governance.

    key people:
    - marco (ceo/cofounder) . big advocate, sees this as the retention bet
    - alex (eng lead) . supportive but worried about A/B test infrastructure
    - jordan (growth) . wants resurface as the retention lever
    - dan (designer) . concerned about the digest feeling spammy
    - chloe (data) . needs instrumentation for the experiment

    want a proper stakeholder map with communication plan.

## Phase: Define

### Problem Statement

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . saved content re-engagement problem statement*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /problem-statement

    the guilt pile problem. users save a ton of stuff to brainshelf but
    never come back to read it. interview data says 5/7 users described
    their library negatively. behavioral data says <9% revisit rate within
    30 days [fictional]. 7-day return rate is 18% [fictional], OKR target
    is 25% [fictional] by end of Q2.

    need a clean problem statement to align the team before we start
    building the resurface hypothesis.
    ```

    ---

??? example "Full output: Problem Statement"
    # Problem Statement: Saved Content Re-Engagement Gap

---

### Hypothesis

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . Resurface morning email digest hypothesis*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /hypothesis

    trying to figure out if a morning digest email will actually get people to re-read
    their saved stuff. context: brainshelf pkm app, 22k MAU [fictional]. users save
    ~47 items/month but only go back to read ~9% within 30 days [fictional]. classic
    guilt pile problem from interviews.

    want to run an A/B test on a morning email that surfaces 3-5 items from their
    library based on what they've been reading lately. need a hypothesis doc to
    align the team before we commit to building it.

    primary metric: resurface item click rate. secondary: actual read completion.
    guardrail: don't tank unsubscribe rate.
    ```

    ---

??? example "Full output: Hypothesis"
    # Hypothesis: Morning Resurface Email Increases Re-Read Rate

---

### Opportunity Tree

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . opportunity tree for saved content re-engagement*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /opportunity-tree

    outcome: increase 7-day return rate from 18% to 25% [fictional]
    by end of Q2 2026.

    three opportunities from interviews + data:
    1. re-engagement trigger gap . users have no external prompt to return
    2. content relevance decay . old saves lose timeliness, making the
       library feel stale
    3. library overwhelm . 400-item undifferentiated list creates avoidance

    solutions I'm considering:
    - opp 1: morning email digest (resurface), in-app notification card
    - opp 2: freshness scoring, auto-archive stale items
    - opp 3: intent tagging at save time, smart collections

    want to prioritize opp 1 / email digest based on competitive analysis
    (readwise is the only proof point for email resurfacing).
    ```

### JTBD Canvas

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . JTBD canvas for saved content re-engagement*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /jtbd-canvas

    the core job for the resurface feature. users save stuff to brainshelf
    with the intent to read it later, but the act of saving satisfies the
    intent . they never actually come back. so the real job isn't "save to
    read later" (that job is already done by the save action), the real job
    is "rediscover the things I saved that are still worth my time."

    based on 7 user interviews (jan 2026). guilt pile is the emotional
    dimension. social dimension: people want to seem well-read but their
    library proves they're not.

    competing solutions: readwise (expensive), browser bookmarks (no resurface),
    doing nothing (guilt pile grows), raindrop.io (organize but no resurface).
    ```

## Phase: Develop

### Solution Brief

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . Resurface feature solution brief for team alignment*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /solution-brief

    resurface one-pager for the team. need to get everyone on the same
    page before sprint 8 starts. marco wants to see it too.

    the solution: daily morning email digest that surfaces 3-5 saved items
    matched to what the user has been reading recently. opt-in required.
    7:30 AM local time. topic matching algorithm picks the items.

    key features: email digest, topic matching, opt-in flow, one-click
    read, cadence setting (daily default, can switch to 3x/week).

    primary metric: 7-day return rate, 18% → 25% [fictional].
    secondary: email CTR. guardrail: unsub rate ≤2%/week.

    explicitly NOT doing: in-app resurfacing (deferred), push notifications
    (too aggressive for first version), smart collections (too big),
    annotation-based resurfacing (that's readwise's approach, we're
    doing topic matching instead).
    ```

### Spike Summary

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . topic-matching algorithm spike for the Resurface digest*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /spike-summary

    topic matching spike for resurface. alex spent 3 days on it last
    week. question: can we build something that picks saved items relevant
    to what the user has been reading recently, accurate enough to not
    annoy people?

    three approaches tested:
    1. tag-based . use OG tags, domain, URL patterns. simplest, no ML.
    2. tfidf . extract article text, vectorize, cosine similarity. no
       external api. medium complexity.
    3. openai embeddings . text-embedding-3-small. highest accuracy but
       adds external dependency and per-call cost.

    benchmark: 3 real user libraries (anonymized), 50 items each,
    manually rated as "relevant" or "not relevant" to recent reading.

    results: tags = ~55% [fictional], tfidf = ~72% [fictional],
    embeddings = ~84% [fictional].

    recommendation: go with tfidf for mvp. meets the 70% bar we set,
    no external dependency. plan to migrate to embeddings later if the
    feature sticks.

### Architecture Decision Record

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . email sending infrastructure decision for the Resurface digest*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /adr

    email sending infra for resurface. we don't have any email sending
    today . everything is in-app or firebase push. need to pick a provider
    for the daily digest.

    options we looked at:
    - sendgrid (twilio): mature, everyone uses it, but their free tier
      shrank and the dashboard is confusing
    - postmark: great deliverability reputation, simple api, but
      transactional only . no batch/digest support without workarounds
    - resend: new, developer-first, react email templates, free tier
      covers our a/b test volume

    alex ran a quick eval last week. we're leaning resend. need the ADR
    written up before sprint 8 starts.
    ```

### Design Rationale

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . digest email layout design decision for the Resurface feature*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /design-rationale

    digest email layout for resurface. dan showed three options:

    option A: rich cards . article thumbnail, title, excerpt, topic tag
    for each item. looks great in figma but heavy on images and might
    trigger promotions tab.

    option B: structured text . article title (linked), source domain,
    topic tag, estimated read time. no images. clean, editorial feel.
    fast to scan.

    option C: minimal plain text . just titles and links, no styling.
    maximum deliverability but looks like a system notification, not a
    product experience.

    we did a quick preference test with 12 users. 9 preferred option B.
    reasons: "fast," "doesn't look like spam," "I'd actually read this."

    going with B. need the rationale written up.

### PRD

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . Resurface feature PRD for Sprint 8 build*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /prd

    resurface prd for sprint 8. pulling everything together: solution brief,
    adr (resend), design rationale (text layout), spike (tfidf).

    building the daily email digest that surfaces 3-5 saved items matched
    to recent reading. opt-in required. 7:30 AM local time. tfidf for
    topic matching. resend for email. text-only layout.

    target users: active savers (10+ items, active in last 30 days) .
    about 9,800 users [fictional].

    metrics: 7-day return rate 18%→25% [fictional], email CTR ≥15% [fictional],
    unsub ≤2%/week [fictional].

    scope: digest email, topic matching, opt-in flow, cadence setting,
    one-click read, analytics events. NOT doing: in-app resurfacing,
    push notifications, smart collections.

    timeline: sprint 8 build (feb 3-16), setup week (mar 2-8),

    2. opt in to digest (P0) . home screen card + settings toggle
    3. click item to read (P0) . one-click from email to article
    4. change cadence (P1) . daily vs 3x/week
    5. unsubscribe from digest (P0) . one-click from email footer

    resurface edge cases for sprint 8. need to cover:
    - what happens when the user's library is too small
    - what happens when all items have been resurfaced recently
    - timezone weirdness (DST, user changes timezone, half-hour offsets)
    - text extraction failures
    - resend api outages
    - user clicks a link to a dead URL
    - email bounces
    - concurrent opt-in/unsubscribe race conditions

    tone: friendly, plain language. not techy. our users are knowledge
    workers who save articles . talk to them about reading, not about
    algorithms.

    highlights: daily email digest with your most relevant saved content,
    delivered every morning. opt-in from home screen. one-click to read.
    change frequency or unsubscribe anytime.

    also: fixed the timezone bug from sprint 8 that sent early-morning
    digests to UK/EU users. and improved text extraction for paywalled
    articles (better fallback to article metadata).

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /experiment-design

    resurface a/b test. feature is shipped behind a flag. need the full
    experiment design for chloe to set up in amplitude.

    hypothesis: daily digest → higher 7-day return rate.

    design: intent-to-treat. treatment gets the opt-in prompt + digest.
    control gets nothing (current experience). measure 7-day return rate
    for both groups.

    secondary metric: email CTR (treatment only . control doesn't get
    email). guardrail: unsub rate ≤2%/week.

    sample: 400 per variant from the 9,800 eligible users [fictional].
    duration: 4 weeks (mar 9 - apr 5). 50/50 split on enrollment cohort.

    want to have the design doc locked before the setup week (mar 2-8).

    resurface analytics events for amplitude. need the full spec before
    sprint 8 starts so alex and jess can instrument during the build.

    events:
    1. resurface_opt_in . user enables the digest
    2. resurface_digest_sent . server sends a digest email
    3. resurface_digest_opened . user opens the email (caveat: apple MPP)
    4. resurface_item_clicked . user clicks an item in the digest
    5. resurface_unsubscribe . user unsubscribes
    6. resurface_cadence_changed . user changes frequency
    7. resurface_digest_skipped . server skips sending (no qualifying items,
       exclusion window exhausted, etc.)

    also need user properties: digest_enabled, digest_cadence, digest_timezone.

    keep it tight. chloe wants to review before sprint planning on monday.

### Dashboard Requirements

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . Resurface experiment dashboard requirements for Amplitude*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /dashboard-requirements

    resurface experiment dashboard for amplitude. need it ready before
    the a/b test starts (mar 9).

    two audiences:
    1. product team (priya, chloe, alex, jordan) . daily monitoring
       during the 4-week test
    2. marco (ceo) . weekly exec check-in, needs a single-screen summary

    questions the dashboard should answer:
    - is the treatment group returning more than control?
    - are users clicking items in the digest?
    - is the unsubscribe rate within the guardrail?
    - what's the opt-in funnel conversion rate?
    - are there segment differences (library size, cadence)?

    charts i want:
    1. 7-day return rate trend (treatment vs control, weekly)
    2. email CTR trend (daily)
    3. opt-in funnel (card viewed → opted in)
    4. unsubscribe rate trend (weekly, with guardrail line)
    5. segment breakdown table (library size, cadence)

    filters: date range, experiment variant, library size segment.

    ```
    /experiment-results

    resurface a/b test results. test ran mar 9 - apr 5 (4 weeks).
    800 users, 50/50 split [fictional].

    headline: treatment won.

    primary metric (7-day return rate):
    - control: 18.1% [fictional]
    - treatment: 23.4% [fictional]
    - delta: +5.3pp, p = 0.008 [fictional]

    secondary (email CTR, treatment only): 17.2% [fictional]
    opt-in rate: 41% of treatment group (164/400) [fictional]

    guardrails all passed:
    - unsub: 1.3%/week [fictional] (under 2% threshold)
    - app uninstall: no difference
    - save rate: no difference

    segments:
    - heavy savers (100+ items): return rate lift = +7.1pp [fictional]
    - light savers (10-50 items): return rate lift = +3.8pp [fictional]
    - daily cadence users: CTR 18.6% [fictional]
    - 3x/week users: CTR 14.1% [fictional]

    surprising: opt-in rate was 41% [fictional], way above the 10% target.
    also surprising: week 4 return rate was HIGHER than week 1 (not
    novelty decay . habit formation).

    recommendation: ship to all eligible users.

### Retrospective

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . Sprint 8 retrospective after Resurface launch*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /retrospective

    sprint 8 retro . resurface launch sprint. need to write this up.

    what happened: we shipped resurface on time! first big feature in 6 months.
    but we also had a timezone bug that sent the morning digest at 5am to UK/Europe
    users (~340 people [fictional]). caught it 6 hours after launch, patched within 2
    hours of catching it, but some users were not happy.

    format: start/stop/continue. small team (7 people in the room).
    2 wins, the timezone thing, and a few process issues that came up.

    previous retro action items were: (1) set up staging environment email testing .
    DONE, (2) add integration test for notification delivery . NOT DONE (this
    contributed to the bug), (3) weekly eng/pm sync . IN PROGRESS.

### Lessons Log

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . timezone handling lesson from the Resurface Sprint 8 launch*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /lessons-log

    lesson from: timezone bug at resurface launch
    what happened: ~340 UK/EU users got their digest at 7:30 UTC instead
    of 7:30 local because the backend didn't recognize "Europe/Kyiv" and
    silently fell back to UTC.

    detected: feb 18, 2026 . alex noticed the send log timestamps were
    wrong for EU users.
    fixed: feb 18, same day . updated IANA database, added explicit
    fallback logging, patched within 2 hours.

    lesson type: failure pattern / technical
    the real lesson isn't the specific bug . it's that we had ZERO
    integration tests for timezone-dependent behavior. the unit tests
    mocked the timezone, so they never caught the gap between the device
    timezone string and the server's IANA database.

### Refinement Notes

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . Sprint 9 refinement for Resurface v2 improvements*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /refinement-notes

    sprint 9 refinement for resurface v2. session was april 15, 2026.
    45 minutes. priya facilitated.

    stories discussed:
    1. RSF-010: embedding migration (tfidf → openai text-embedding-3-small)
       . BLOCKED, waiting on openai api key + budget approval from marco
    2. RSF-011: in-app resurfacing card on home screen . Ready, 5 pts [fictional]
    3. RSF-012: cadence experiment (daily vs 3x/week, larger sample) .
       Ready, 3 pts [fictional]
    4. RSF-013: small-library handling (users with <20 items, shorter
       exclusion window) . Needs Work, alex wants to see the data first

    questions raised: should the in-app card show different items than
    the email digest or the same items? what's the minimum library size
    where tfidf actually produces useful results?

    decision: in-app card shows different items (complementary, not
    duplicate).
    ```

### Pivot Decision

*Brainshelf consumer PKM app . post-experiment persevere decision for Resurface*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /pivot-decision

    post-experiment pivot decision for resurface. a/b test showed +5.3pp
    lift in 7-day return rate, p=0.008 [fictional]. all guardrails passed.

    recommending: persevere . ship to all eligible users, invest in v2.

    alternatives considered:
    1. persevere: ship email digest, iterate on relevance and cadence
    2. pivot to push notifications: replace email with mobile push as the
       trigger mechanism
    3. pivot to in-app resurfacing: replace email with in-app notification
       card (deferred from the original opportunity tree as solution 1B)

    need the formal decision doc for marco. decision date: april 11, 2026.
    ```
