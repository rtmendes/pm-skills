    /stakeholder-summary

    Project: Workbench Blueprints -- reusable document templates with required sections and role-based approval gates
    Product: Workbench (enterprise collaboration platform, Series B, ~200 employees, ~500 enterprise customers [fictional])
    Stage: Pre-development. Discovery interviews complete. About to enter Define phase.
    PM: Rachel V. (Technical PM, Blueprints)

    Stakeholders to map:

    Internal:
    1. Sandra C. -- Head of Product. Blueprints sponsor. Approves scope and timeline. Wants Blueprints to drive enterprise expansion and reduce churn in the compliance segment.
    2. James W. -- VP Engineering. Owns engineering allocation. Concerned about CRDT complexity and timeline risk. Supportive but cautious.
    3. Karen L. -- Engineering Lead, Blueprints squad. Day-to-day engineering owner. Excited about the technical challenge. Needs clear requirements early.
    4. Derek H. -- Head of Marketing. Owns GA positioning and messaging. Needs competitive differentiation story for enterprise sales enablement.
    5. Mei-Lin T. -- Enterprise Sales Lead. Manages the top 50 enterprise accounts. Wants Blueprints to close pipeline deals stalled on governance gaps. Resistant to phased rollout -- wants everything at once.

    External:
    6. IT Security leads at enterprise customer accounts. Gate SSO and data residency requirements. Will block deployment if security posture is insufficient.
    7. Confluence-migrant accounts (estimated 15 of 80 closed-beta customers [fictional]). High-value, high-risk -- switching cost makes them sticky if onboarding goes well, churnable if it doesn't.

## Phase: Define

### Problem Statement

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: enterprise documentation completeness gap*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /problem-statement

    Product: Workbench (enterprise collaboration platform, Series B, ~500 enterprise customers [fictional])
    Feature area: Document templates and approval workflows (Blueprints)

    The problem: Enterprise teams create documents using templates but no tool enforces template completion before a document enters the approval workflow. Result: approvers receive incomplete documents, send them back, and the approval cycle inflates from what should be a same-day decision to a multi-day back-and-forth.

    Who is affected: Primarily two personas -- (1) document authors (project leads, ops managers) who use templates but don't complete every section; (2) approvers (department heads, compliance leads) who receive incomplete documents and must either reject and wait or approve and accept compliance risk.

    Scale:
    - 38% of Blueprints in closed beta reach approval with ≥1 empty required section [fictional]
    - 60% of enterprise projects in our customer base lack an approved kickoff document at the time of project handoff [fictional]
    - Median time to first approval: 4.0 days [fictional]; estimated 3 of those days are queue time while the doc is bounced back for completion
    - Approvers review ~15 docs/month on average; at least half are incomplete [fictional]

    Strategic context:
    - H1 2026 OKR: expand enterprise customer base from 500 to 650 [fictional]
    - Enterprise churn in compliance-heavy segments (healthcare, financial services, government) is 18% annual [fictional]; governance tooling is the most-requested feature in churn exit surveys
    - Series C fundraise planned for late 2026; enterprise traction is the anchor narrative
    - Competitive gap: no doc-first tool (Confluence, Notion, Coda) enforces template section completion; Monday.com has approval workflows but is not a document tool

    Stakeholders: Sandra C. (Head of Product), Mei-Lin T. (Enterprise Sales Lead)

### Hypothesis

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: required-section enforcement hypothesis*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /hypothesis

    Product: Workbench Blueprints (enterprise doc templates with required sections and approval gates)
    Stage: Define phase, post-discovery interviews and problem statement

    Hypothesis: Requiring all Blueprint sections to be completed before an author can submit for approval will reduce median time to first approved Blueprint.

    Context:
    - 38% of Blueprints in closed beta reach approval with ≥1 empty required section [fictional]
    - Median time to first approval: 4.0 days [fictional]
    - Most rejections are for missing content, not quality [fictional]
    - Approvers (dept heads, compliance leads) are the bottleneck -- they reject and wait, or approve with risk
    - Target: reduce median approval time to ≤1 day [fictional] (aspirational)
    - MDE for experiment: 1.0 day reduction (to ≤3.0 days) [fictional]

    Target users: Project leads and document authors at enterprise Workbench accounts
    Validation: A/B test in closed beta (80 accounts, ~300 Blueprints/week [fictional])
    Primary metric: median time-to-first-approval (days)
    Guardrails: author abandonment, author NPS

    Stakeholders: Sandra C. (Head of Product), Karen L. (Eng Lead), Leo M. (Data Analyst)

### Opportunity Tree

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: enterprise expansion via governance, SSO, and Confluence migration*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /opportunity-tree

    Product: Workbench Blueprints (enterprise doc templates with required sections and approval gates)
    Stage: Define phase, post-discovery and problem statement

    Desired outcome: Expand Workbench enterprise customer base from 500 to 650 accounts within 12 months [fictional]
    Current state: 500 enterprise customers [fictional]; enterprise churn in compliance segments is 18% annual [fictional]; 8 pipeline deals ($1.8M ARR) stalled on governance gaps [fictional]
    Timeframe: 12 months from GA launch
    Owner: Sandra C. (Head of Product)

    Opportunities identified from discovery research:
    1. Documentation governance gap -- no enterprise doc tool enforces template completion; 38% of docs reach approval incomplete [fictional]; enterprise teams need "templates with teeth"
    2. SSO and security parity gap -- enterprise IT blocks deployment of tools without SSO/SAML, audit logs, and SOC 2; this is a pre-qualification filter, not a differentiator, but it is a hard gate
    3. Confluence migration friction -- 4 of 6 interview participants had Confluence experience; all described migration as expensive and risky; Blueprints must offer a capability Confluence cannot provide to justify the migration cost

    Solutions to explore per opportunity:
    - Governance: required-section enforcement, native approval gates, template admin controls
    - SSO/security: SAML integration, audit log export, SOC 2 Type II, data residency options
    - Migration: Confluence template import, guided manual migration, migration support program

    Prioritization: Governance is highest impact and highest confidence. SSO is table stakes (must-have, not differentiator). Migration is medium confidence (we believe it drives adoption but have not tested).

### JTBD Canvas

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: Blueprints JTBD for ops managers enforcing documentation standards*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /jtbd-canvas

    Product: Workbench Blueprints (enterprise doc templates with required sections and approval gates)
    Stage: Define phase, post-discovery interviews

    Job performer: Operations managers and team leads at enterprise companies (500-10,000 employees) who are responsible for ensuring documentation standards are followed across their teams. They are not the approvers (those are department heads) -- they are the middle layer who currently enforce standards manually.

    Circumstance: When a new project kicks off, a compliance review is due, or a vendor onboarding begins, these managers need to ensure the team produces a complete, approved document before work proceeds. Currently they manually review documents for completeness -- a shadow approval role that takes ~3 hours/week [fictional].

    Core job: Enforce documentation standards across the team without becoming the "docs police" -- without spending their time checking whether other people filled in every section.

    Current solutions they "hire":
    - Confluence templates (direct competitor) -- has templates but no enforcement; "docs graveyard" problem
    - Notion (direct competitor) -- beautiful UX, zero governance; "flexibility over standards" philosophy
    - SharePoint + email approval chains (indirect) -- separate tools stitched together; works but is slow and fragile
    - Manual review by the manager themselves (non-consumption) -- the current workaround; reliable but time-consuming and resented

    Key interview quotes to incorporate:
    - P6: "I don't want to be the docs police. I want the tool to be the docs police." [fictional]
    - P1: "Templates without enforcement are just suggestions with formatting." [fictional]
    - P4: "If one tool did both -- the doc and the approval -- we'd move tomorrow." [fictional]

    Stakeholders: Sandra C. (Head of Product), Tomás G. (Design Lead)

## Phase: Develop

### Solution Brief

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: Blueprints solution brief (one-pager)*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /solution-brief

    Product: Workbench Blueprints -- reusable document templates with required sections and role-based approval gates
    Stage: Pre-PRD; consolidating decisions from discovery, define, and develop phases into a one-pager

    Problem recap:
    - 38% of enterprise documents reach approval with >=1 empty required section [fictional]
    - Median time to first approval: 4.0 days [fictional]; most of that is rejection-revision cycles
    - 60% of enterprise projects lack an approved kickoff doc at handoff [fictional]
    - No doc-first competitor enforces template section completion

    Proposed solution:
    - Blueprint templates with required and optional sections, designated by template admins
    - Required-section enforcement at submission (Submit button disabled until all required sections complete)
    - Native role-based approval gates (single-stage approval in v1; multi-stage in v1.1)
    - Real-time co-editing via Yjs CRDTs (offline-first, 20+ concurrent editors [fictional])
    - Hybrid creation flow: guided wizard for first-time authors, blank canvas for returning authors
    - SAML SSO, audit logs, and SCIM provisioning for enterprise deployment

    Key features (5):
    1. Required-section enforcement
    2. Native approval gates
    3. Yjs-powered co-editing
    4. Hybrid wizard/canvas creation flow
    5. Enterprise security (SAML, audit logs, SCIM)

    Success metrics:
    - Median time to first approval: 4.0 days -> <=2.5 days [fictional]
    - Approval rejection rate: 38% -> <=15% [fictional]
    - Enterprise accounts with active Blueprints: 200 of 500 within 6 months of GA [fictional]
    - Enterprise churn (compliance segment): 18% -> <=12% within 12 months [fictional]

    Trade-offs: No AI-assisted drafting in v1 (Partial per competitive analysis); no multi-stage approval in v1; no Confluence template import in v1 (guided manual migration only)

    Risks: CRDT complexity (mitigated by spike); author abandonment from enforcement (mitigated by A/B test); Atlassian Rovo response (monitor)

### Spike Summary

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: CRDT library evaluation for Blueprint co-editing*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /spike-summary

    Spike: CRDT library evaluation for Blueprints real-time co-editing
    Product: Workbench (enterprise collaboration platform)
    Engineer: Nate P. (Backend Engineer)
    Duration: 5 days (Dec 1-5, 2025)

    Background:
    - Blueprints requires real-time co-editing (20+ concurrent editors per document [fictional])
    - Our editor is ProseMirror-based; no current collaboration layer
    - Enterprise requirements: offline-first, conflict resolution, per-user audit trail
    - Target: 20+ concurrent editors, <100ms merge latency [fictional]

    Libraries evaluated:
    1. Yjs (CRDT, MIT) -- y-prosemirror binding; offline-first; sub-document support
    2. Automerge (CRDT, MIT) -- Rust/WASM; strong offline; no ProseMirror binding
    3. ShareDB (OT, MIT) -- central server model; mature; no offline support

    Findings from prototype:
    - Yjs: integrated in 2 days; 45ms merge latency at 20 users [fictional]; +38KB gzipped [fictional]; offline works out of box
    - Automerge: no ProseMirror binding (3-4 week custom build [fictional]); +120KB gzipped [fictional]; excellent offline
    - ShareDB: integrated in 1.5 days; 62ms merge latency [fictional]; +22KB gzipped [fictional]; NO offline (disqualified)

### Architecture Decision Record

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: ADR for Yjs CRDTs for Blueprint co-editing*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /adr

    ADR: Use Yjs CRDTs for Blueprints real-time co-editing
    Product: Workbench Blueprints
    Stage: Post-CRDT spike; recording architecture decision

    Context:
    - Blueprints requires real-time co-editing (20+ concurrent editors [fictional])
    - ProseMirror-based editor; no current collaboration layer
    - Enterprise requirements: offline-first, conflict resolution, per-user audit trail
    - Spike evaluated Yjs, Automerge, ShareDB

    Decision: Yjs
    - 2-day integration via y-prosemirror; 45ms merge latency at 20 users [fictional]; +38KB gzipped [fictional]; offline-first
    - Automerge rejected: no ProseMirror binding (3-4 week custom build [fictional]); +120KB [fictional]
    - ShareDB rejected: no offline support (disqualified)

    Consequences:
    - Positive: fast integration, offline-first, active community, sub-document support
    - Negative: WebSocket provider TBD, audit trail requires custom middleware, binary document format
    - Neutral: bundle size acceptable for enterprise

### Design Rationale

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: guided wizard vs. blank canvas for Blueprint creation flow*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /design-rationale

    Decision: Blueprint creation flow -- guided wizard vs. blank canvas
    Product: Workbench Blueprints (enterprise doc templates with required sections and approval gates)
    Stage: Develop phase, pre-PRD

    Problem: How should a new Blueprint be created? Two options:
    - Option A: Guided wizard -- step-by-step flow, one section per screen, progress indicator, validation per step
    - Option B: Blank canvas -- full template opens in the editor, all sections visible, fill in any order (Confluence model)
    - Option C (hybrid): Wizard for first-time creation, canvas for returning authors who have completed a Blueprint before

    Context:
    - Enterprise users are not power users of Workbench yet -- Blueprints is a new feature
    - Required sections are the core differentiator; the creation flow must make enforcement feel helpful, not punitive
    - Discovery interviews: middle managers act as "docs police"; the creation flow should reduce, not increase, that burden
    - Closed-beta preference test (8 users [fictional]): 6 preferred wizard on first use, 5 preferred canvas after their second Blueprint
    - Karen L. (Eng Lead): wizard adds 1 sprint of effort vs. canvas [fictional]
    - Tomas G. (Design Lead): wizard produces cleaner first submissions but risks feeling patronizing for experienced authors

    Evaluation criteria: first-submission completeness rate, author time-to-submit, author satisfaction (NPS), engineering effort, scalability to custom templates

    Stakeholders: Sandra C. (Head of Product), Karen L. (Eng Lead), Tomas G. (Design Lead)

## Phase: Deliver

### PRD

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform - Blueprints v1 PRD for required-section enforcement and approval gates*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /prd

    Here is the structured brief for the Blueprints v1 PRD.

    **Product context:**
    - Workbench collaboration platform, ~500 enterprise customers [fictional], Series B
    - Blueprints = reusable document templates with required sections and approval gates
    - Core problem: 38% of Blueprints reach approval with ≥1 empty section [fictional]; median time to first approval is 4.0 days [fictional]; 60% of enterprise projects lack an approved kickoff doc at handoff [fictional]

    **Prior decisions to incorporate:**
    - ADR-012: Yjs CRDTs selected for real-time co-editing (45ms merge latency at 20 concurrent editors [fictional], +38KB gzipped [fictional])
    - Design rationale: Hybrid wizard/canvas -- guided wizard for first-time authors, blank canvas for returning authors
    - Opportunity tree: Priority path is documentation governance gap → required-section enforcement
    - Hypothesis: Required sections reduce time-to-approved from 4.0 days to ≤2.5 days [fictional]; validation via A/B test (Mar 9 -- Apr 5, 2026)

    **Target users:** Enterprise ops managers (creators), department heads (approvers), IT security leads (admin/provisioning)

    **Key features for v1:**
    1. Required-section enforcement (submit button disabled until all required sections complete)
    2. Native approval gates (role-based routing, sequential and parallel approval)
    3. Yjs real-time co-editing (offline-first, sub-document-level sync)
    4. Hybrid wizard/canvas creation flow
    5. Enterprise security suite (SAML SSO, audit logs, role-based access)

    **Timeline:** Closed beta running now with 80 accounts [fictional]; A/B test Mar 9 -- Apr 5; GA target April 2026

    **Success metrics:** Time-to-approved ≤2.5 days [fictional], empty-section rate ≤10% [fictional], enterprise account growth from 500 to 650 in 12 months [fictional]

### User Stories

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform - Blueprints v1 sprint stories for required sections and approval gates*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /user-stories

    I need two user stories for the Blueprints v1 sprint backlog. These are the two highest-priority stories for the first sprint.

    **Story 1 -- Required-section enforcement (author perspective):**
    - Persona: Ops manager creating a Blueprint from a template with required sections
    - Core need: Cannot submit an incomplete document for approval
    - Key behaviors: Required sections show a visual indicator; submit button disabled until all required sections have content; if content is deleted, submit re-disables
    - Context: Part of the hybrid wizard/canvas flow; applies to both wizard and canvas modes
    - Relates to: A/B test hypothesis (required vs. optional sections, Mar 9 -- Apr 5)

    **Story 2 -- Approval gate (approver perspective):**
    - Persona: Department head reviewing a submitted Blueprint
    - Core need: Review complete documents efficiently with clear approve/reject actions
    - Key behaviors: Notification on submission; inline section review; approve, reject with required comment, or request changes; Blueprint marked approved when all required approvers complete
    - Context: Sequential and parallel approval chains configured per template by admin

    For each story, include full acceptance criteria, design notes, technical notes, dependencies, out of scope, and open questions.

### Edge Cases

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform - Blueprints edge-case analysis for approval workflows and co-editing*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /edge-cases

    I need a comprehensive edge-case analysis for Blueprints v1 covering the three highest-risk areas: required-section enforcement boundaries, approval-gate state transitions, and real-time co-editing conflicts.

    **Context:**
    - Required sections use a content-presence check (non-whitespace); submit is disabled until all required sections have content
    - Approval gates support sequential and parallel chains; state stored in relational DB, not in the Yjs document
    - Co-editing uses Yjs CRDTs with sub-document-level sync; offline edits cache locally and merge on reconnect
    - 80 closed-beta accounts [fictional], target ~20 concurrent editors per Blueprint [fictional]

    **What I need:**
    - Edge cases organized by category
    - Error messages for each failure state
    - Recovery paths so QA and engineering know the expected behavior
    - Prioritized test scenarios (P1 must-test, P2 should-test, P3 nice-to-test)

    Please be thorough -- Karen's team will use this directly for test planning.

### Launch Checklist

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform - Blueprints v1 GA launch readiness checklist*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /launch-checklist

    I need a comprehensive launch checklist for Blueprints v1 GA. Here's the context:

    **Launch details:**
    - Launch name: Blueprints GA
    - Target date: April 28, 2026
    - Rollout: From 80 closed-beta accounts to all ~500 enterprise customers [fictional]
    - Ship decision confirmed by Sandra C. on April 14, 2026

    **Key stakeholders:**
    - Rachel V. (PM), Karen L. (Eng Lead), Tomás G. (Design Lead), Derek H. (Head of Marketing), Mei-Lin T. (Enterprise Sales Lead), James W. (VP Eng)

    **Critical items I'm tracking:**
    - SAML SSO certification -- must be complete before GA (enterprise blocker)
    - IT admin provisioning guide -- enterprise security teams need this before they'll onboard
    - Confluence migration communication plan -- many prospects are switching from Confluence
    - A/B test code cleanup -- remove experiment flags, ship required-sections as default
    - WebSocket provider scaling -- validated at 80 accounts, need to load test for 500

    **Rollback concern:** If a critical bug surfaces in the first 48 hours, we need a clean rollback to the pre-Blueprints state without data loss for accounts that already created Blueprints during GA.

    Please generate the full launch checklist with go/no-go criteria and a rollback plan.

### Release Notes

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform - Workbench 3.5 release notes for Blueprints GA*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /release-notes

    I need customer-facing release notes for Workbench 3.5, which ships Blueprints GA.

    **Highlights (top 2 features to call out):**
    1. Blueprints with required-section enforcement -- the headline feature; reduces incomplete document submissions
    2. Real-time co-editing -- powered by Yjs CRDTs; multiple authors can work simultaneously, including offline

    **New features to cover:**
    - Required-section enforcement (submit gated on section completeness)
    - Native approval gates (sequential and parallel chains, role-based routing)
    - Real-time co-editing (offline-first, presence awareness)
    - Hybrid wizard/canvas creation flow
    - SAML SSO integration and audit logs

    **Improvements:**
    - Template gallery redesign (faster browsing, search)
    - Notification system updated for approval events
    - Document editor performance (15% faster load time [fictional] from bundle optimization)

    **Bug fixes:**
    - Fixed: document auto-save occasionally failed on slow connections
    - Fixed: role assignment changes did not propagate until page refresh
    - Fixed: exported PDFs missing footer page numbers

    **Known issues:**
    - Co-editing cursor labels may overlap when 10+ editors are in the same section
    - Wizard auto-disable threshold (12 sections) is not configurable by admins in v1

    **Coming soon (v1.1 preview):**
    - Version history for Blueprints
    - Approval delegation (OOO forwarding)
    - Section-level commenting
    - Jira two-way sync

    Tone: professional, clear, no hype. Enterprise audience.

## Phase: Measure

### Experiment Design

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: Blueprints required vs. optional sections A/B test*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /experiment-design

    Experiment: Required vs. optional Blueprint sections
    Product: Workbench Blueprints (enterprise doc templates with approval gates)
    Stage: Closed beta shipped; need to A/B test before expanding to full 500-customer base [fictional]

    Context:
    - Blueprints allows admins to create doc templates with sections
    - Currently all sections are optional -- authors can submit incomplete Blueprints for approval
    - Data: 38% of Blueprints reach approval with ≥1 empty section [fictional]; most rejections are for missing content, not quality
    - Hypothesis from Define phase: making sections required (must complete before submitting) reduces time to first approval
    - Baseline: median time to first approved Blueprint = 4.0 days [fictional]
    - Goal: reduce to ≤2.5 days [fictional]

    Treatment: Required sections -- authoring UI blocks submission if any required section is empty. Show inline validation message, highlight empty sections.
    Control: Current optional sections -- authors can submit with empty sections as today.

    Primary metric: median time-to-first-approval (days)
    Secondary: approval rejection rate, Blueprint completion rate
    Guardrail: don't tank author-side NPS or increase abandonment

    Audience: Project leads at enterprise customers in closed beta (excludes IT admins and approvers).
    Stakeholders: Head of Product, Data Science, Engineering Lead (Blueprints)
    ```

### Instrumentation Spec

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: Blueprints v1 GA instrumentation spec*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /instrumentation-spec

    I need the instrumentation spec for Blueprints v1 GA. Here are the events I've identified from the PRD and experiment results:

    **Core lifecycle events:**
    1. `blueprint_created` -- when an author creates a new Blueprint from a template
    2. `section_completed` -- when a required section transitions from empty to non-empty
    3. `section_cleared` -- when a required section transitions from non-empty to empty
    4. `approval_requested` -- when an author submits a Blueprint for approval
    5. `approval_granted` -- when an approver approves a Blueprint
    6. `approval_rejected` -- when an approver rejects a Blueprint
    7. `blueprint_published` -- when an approved Blueprint is published to the team workspace

    **Key properties I need on each event:**
    - Standard: account_id, user_id, blueprint_id, template_id, timestamp
    - blueprint_created: creation_method (wizard/canvas), template_name, required_section_count, optional_section_count
    - section_completed/cleared: section_id, section_name, is_required, word_count
    - approval events: approval_chain_type (sequential/parallel), approver_position, approval_cycle_number
    - blueprint_published: time_to_approved_hours, total_approval_cycles, co_editor_count

    **PII concerns:**
    - user_id is internal (UUID), not PII
    - We must NOT capture section content in events -- only metadata
    - Account names should not appear in event properties; use account_id only

    **SDK:** Workbench Analytics SDK (server-side collector, JavaScript client)

    Please generate the full instrumentation spec with testing checklist.

### Dashboard Requirements

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: Blueprints post-launch monitoring dashboard requirements*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /dashboard-requirements

    I need dashboard requirements for the Blueprints post-launch monitoring dashboard. Here's the context:

    **Audiences:**
    1. Rachel V. (PM) -- daily check: adoption trends, approval bottlenecks, template usage
    2. Sandra C. (Head of Product) -- weekly review: executive summary, account growth, key health metrics
    3. Karen L. (Engineering) -- real-time: system health, merge latency, error rates

    **Key metrics from the PRD and experiment results:**
    - Median time-to-approved (target: ≤2.5 days [fictional])
    - Empty-section submission rate (target: ≤10% [fictional])
    - Approval cycle count (target: ≤1.5 cycles [fictional])
    - Blueprint adoption: monthly active Blueprint creators (target: 2,000 [fictional])
    - Enterprise account growth (target: 500 → 650 in 12 months [fictional])

    **Data sources:**
    - Workbench analytics pipeline (event data from instrumentation spec)
    - WebSocket provider telemetry (merge latency, connection count, error rate)
    - CRM pipeline (account growth, enterprise tier)
    - Support ticketing system (Blueprint-related ticket volume)

    **Visualization preferences:**
    - Time-to-approved: trend line over time (weekly median)
    - Adoption: stacked area chart by department/template type
    - Approval funnel: horizontal funnel chart
    - System health: real-time gauges with alert thresholds

    Please generate the full dashboard requirements including layout, filters, alerts, and acceptance criteria.

### Experiment Results

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: Blueprints required-section enforcement A/B test results*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /experiment-results

    Leo M. just finished the A/B test analysis. I need a full experiment-results document for the April 14 ship-decision meeting. Here are the results:

    **Experiment details:**
    - Name: Required-Section Enforcement A/B Test
    - Duration: Mar 9 -- Apr 5, 2026 (28 days)
    - Accounts: 80 closed-beta enterprise accounts [fictional]; 40 treatment, 40 control
    - Randomization: Account-level (all users within an account see the same variant)
    - Total Blueprints created during test: 612 (298 treatment, 314 control) [fictional]

    **Primary metric:**
    - Median time-to-approved: Treatment 2.4 days [fictional] vs. Control 4.0 days [fictional]
    - Relative change: -40% [fictional]
    - Mann-Whitney U test: p = 0.001
    - 95% CI for median difference: 1.2 -- 2.0 days [fictional]

    **Secondary metrics:**
    - Empty-section submission rate: Treatment 6% [fictional] vs. Control 37% [fictional]
    - Approval cycle count: Treatment 1.4 [fictional] vs. Control 2.3 [fictional]
    - Blueprint completion rate (% of started Blueprints that reach approval): Treatment 78% [fictional] vs. Control 71% [fictional]

    **Guardrail metrics:**
    - Author satisfaction (in-app survey, 1-5 scale): Treatment 3.8 [fictional] vs. Control 3.9 [fictional] (not significant, p=0.42)
    - Blueprint creation rate (Blueprints started per account per week): Treatment 3.7 [fictional] vs. Control 3.9 [fictional] (not significant, p=0.31)
    - Average section word count: Treatment 142 words [fictional] vs. Control 128 words [fictional] (significant, p=0.03)

    **Segment analysis:**
    - By company size: Large (200+ employees): -44% time-to-approved [fictional]; Mid (50-199): -38% [fictional]; Small (10-49): -31% [fictional]
    - By template type: Project kickoff templates: -45% [fictional]; Process documentation: -35% [fictional]; Meeting notes: -22% [fictional]

    **Surprising finding:** Authors in the treatment group wrote 11% more words per section on average [fictional]. We think the required-section badges acted as a psychological prompt to write more thoroughly.

    **Recommendation:** Ship. Required-section enforcement exceeded our MDE of 1.0 day with high confidence.

## Phase: Iterate

### Retrospective

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: Blueprints v1 GA post-launch retrospective*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /retrospective

    I'm facilitating the Blueprints post-GA retrospective. Here's the context:

    **Session details:**
    - Date: May 12, 2026
    - Duration: 90 minutes
    - Format: Virtual (Zoom), structured facilitation

    **Attendees:** Rachel V. (PM, facilitator), Karen L. (Eng Lead), Tomás G. (Design Lead), Nate P. (Backend Eng), Aisha K. (Frontend Eng), Leo M. (Data Analyst), Sandra C. (Head of Product, observer)

    **Context:**
    - Blueprints v1 GA launched April 28, progressive rollout completed May 5
    - 320/500 accounts active on Blueprints [fictional]; remaining 180 in onboarding pipeline
    - Time-to-approved holding at 2.4 days [fictional] (target: ≤2.5)
    - 3 launch-week incidents: (1) approval UX confusion -- 23 support tickets from first-time approvers who couldn't find the reject button, (2) SSO incident day 2 -- misconfigured SAML attribute mapping blocked 12 accounts for 3 hours, (3) wizard threshold rigidity -- 8 enterprise templates with 15+ sections couldn't use the wizard at all

    **What went well:**
    - A/B test methodology was solid; ship decision was data-driven and confident
    - Progressive rollout caught the SSO issue at 10% before it hit all accounts
    - Yjs co-editing performance exceeded targets (32ms p95 merge latency vs. 50ms target [fictional])
    - Cross-functional coordination between eng, design, and marketing was the best it's been

    **What to improve:**
    - Approval UX needed more usability testing before launch
    - SSO configuration was manual and error-prone; need automated validation
    - Wizard threshold should be configurable, not hardcoded
    - Edge-case doc was excellent but QA didn't have time to test all P2 scenarios

    **Action items I want to formalize:** 5 items for v1.1 sprint planning

    Please generate the full retrospective document.

### Lessons Log

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: Blueprints skip-and-submit enforcement lesson*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /lessons-log

    I need to document a lesson learned from the Blueprints launch. Here's the context:

    **Title:** Required-Section Enforcement Caused Skip-and-Submit Behavior

    **What happened:**
    - Required-section enforcement successfully reduced the empty-section submission rate from 37% to 7% [fictional]
    - But post-launch analysis revealed that approximately 4% of submitted Blueprints contain placeholder text in required sections [fictional] -- authors typing "TBD," "See above," "Will update," or pasting Lorem Ipsum to clear the gate
    - Combined, 11% of Blueprints reaching approval still have quality issues [fictional] (7% empty + 4% placeholder), vs. our 10% target
    - This was flagged as a risk in the PRD (Risk row 1: "Required sections cause author frustration and workarounds") but we underestimated the speed of adoption
    - The root cause: we enforced completeness at the wrong point. Blocking submit punishes the author but doesn't help the approver. Approvers still have to manually check for placeholder text.

    **The lesson:**
    - Enforce quality at the approval gate, not the authoring gate
    - Shift from "block the author from submitting" to "give the approver a completeness score"
    - The submit gate should remain (it catches genuine omissions) but add a visible completeness/quality signal to the approval view

    **Team:** Rachel V., Karen L., Leo M.
    **Timeline:** Identified May 10, 2026 (Leo M.'s 2-week post-launch analysis); documented May 14

    Please generate the full lessons-log entry.

### Refinement Notes

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: Blueprints v1.1 backlog refinement session*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /refinement-notes

    I just ran the v1.1 refinement session. Here are the details:

    **Session info:**
    - Date: May 26, 2026
    - Duration: 60 minutes
    - Attendees: Rachel V. (PM, facilitator), Karen L. (Eng Lead), Tomás G. (Design), Nate P. (Backend), Aisha K. (Frontend), Leo M. (Data)

    **Stories refined (6):**

    1. BLUE-201: Approval action bar redesign -- promote Reject and Request Changes to primary visibility
       - Points: 3 (was 2 from retro; increased after discussion of animation transitions)
       - Ready for sprint

    2. BLUE-202: Audit trail export (CSV) -- compliance officer can export all Blueprint lifecycle events for a date range
       - Points: 8
       - Ready for sprint
       - Note: Nate P. flagged that the current audit log stores events in an append-only format optimized for writes, not reads. The export query will need a read-optimized view or materialized table.

    3. BLUE-203: Audit trail export (PDF) -- formatted PDF export for regulatory submissions
       - Points: 5
       - Blocked -- depends on BLUE-202 (CSV export provides the data layer); also needs legal review of the PDF format for FDA/SOX compliance

    4. BLUE-204: Configurable wizard threshold -- template admins can set the section count at which the wizard auto-disables (default: 12)
       - Points: 2
       - Ready for sprint

    5. BLUE-205: Approver-visible completeness score -- display per-section quality indicators in the approval review view
       - Points: 8
       - Ready for sprint (design review scheduled for May 28)
       - Note: Tomás G. proposed a progress bar showing "% sections with 20+ words" plus yellow warning badges on sections below threshold. Karen L. asked whether the threshold should be configurable -- team decided to hardcode 20 words for v1.1 and make it configurable in v1.2 if needed.

    6. BLUE-206: Compliance officer role -- new RBAC role with template-lock and audit-export permissions
       - Points: 13
       - Blocked -- depends on BLUE-202 (audit export) for the export permission; also needs Karen L. to design the RBAC extension architecture

    **Questions raised:**
    - Should the audit trail export include section-level edit history or just lifecycle events? (Decision: lifecycle events only for v1.1; section-level history deferred to version history feature)
    - Should the completeness score be visible to authors during editing, or only to approvers? (Decision: approvers only for now; author-visible is a future consideration)
    - What happens to in-flight Blueprints when a compliance officer locks a template? (Parked for BLUE-206 design)

    **Decisions made:**
    - Wizard threshold default stays at 12 (consistency with v1) but is now admin-configurable
    - Completeness word-count threshold is hardcoded at 20 words for v1.1
    - Audit trail export scope is lifecycle events only (not section edit history)

    Please generate the full refinement notes.

### Pivot Decision

*Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: Blueprints customer segment pivot decision*

!!! quote "Prompt"
    ```
    /pivot-decision

    I need a formal pivot-decision document for the exec team. Here's the situation:

    **Current state:**
    - Blueprints GA launched April 28, 2026; 320/500 accounts active [fictional]
    - Time-to-approved: 2.4 days [fictional] (on target)
    - But adoption is uneven: 68% of active Blueprints come from ops/compliance teams [fictional]; 8% from engineering [fictional]; 24% from other departments [fictional]
    - Sales pipeline: 6 of 8 stalled deals ($1.8M ARR [fictional]) are in regulated industries waiting for compliance-specific features (audit trail export, regulatory template library, compliance officer role)

    **Options:**
    1. Persevere: Continue horizontal strategy; invest equally across all department use cases
    2. Customer segment pivot: Narrow focus to ops/compliance teams in regulated industries; defer engineering templates to v2
    3. Hybrid: Ship the compliance features that unblock the $1.8M pipeline, but keep the horizontal template system

    **My recommendation:** Option 2 (customer segment pivot). The data is clear that ops/compliance is where the product-market fit is strongest. Engineering teams need fundamentally different features (code review integration, CI/CD hooks, Jira-native workflow) that would take 6+ months to build. Narrowing focus now lets us win the compliance segment, hit the 650-account target [fictional], and return to engineering in v2 with dedicated investment.

    **Key concern from Sandra C.:** She worries that narrowing the segment limits the TAM for Series C fundraising. Mei-Lin T. counters that regulated-industry compliance is a $4.2B TAM [fictional] and growing.
