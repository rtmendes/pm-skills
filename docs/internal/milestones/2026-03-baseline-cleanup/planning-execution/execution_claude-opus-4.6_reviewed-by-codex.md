## Executive Summary

Claude's execution plan contains several good cleanup tasks, but the claim that the Claude and Codex workstreams have "no cross-dependencies" is too strong.

Current Codex view:

- `A-1`, `A-2`, `A-3`, and `A-4` are safe to execute now.
- `A-8` and `A-9` are directionally aligned, but they are second-wave work, not first-wave baseline cleanup.
- `A-5` is blocked by the unresolved `.claude` baseline decision.
- `A-11` should wait until the durable effort-placement decision is explicitly signed off.

The main reason is simple:

- `.claude/**` is still an unresolved baseline policy question.
- durable effort placement is now likely `docs/internal/efforts/**`, not a new `docs/internal/features/**` tree, but that still needs owner sign-off before execution work creates new tracked artifacts and GitHub issues.

## Task Review Matrix

| Task | Codex status | Why | Required adjustment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `A-1` Commit `.claude/settings.json` deletion | safe now | Aligns with the narrower `.claude` baseline and matches live repo state: `.claude/settings.json` is currently a pending deletion in `git status`. | None |
| `A-2` Fix `CHANGELOG.md` `_NOTES/` reference | safe now | Directly aligns with the Codex baseline goal to stop treating `_NOTES/**` as canonical in tracked docs. | None |
| `A-3` Remove `docs/templates/skill-template.md` stub | safe now | Repo housekeeping only. The file exists and is currently a zero-byte stub beside the real `docs/templates/skill-template/` directory. | None |
| `A-4` Update `AGENTS/claude/CONTEXT.md` | safe now | Aligns with the shared recommendation to keep both agent surfaces current. | Pair later with a separate Codex update to `AGENTS/codex/CONTEXT.md` |
| `A-5` Add CONTEXT check to `wrap-session` | blocked for now | The only live `wrap-session` definitions are under `.claude/**`. Codex currently recommends treating `.claude/commands/**` and `.claude/skills/**` as retire-or-migrate, not baseline truth. The task also assumes a canonical source outside `.claude/**`, which does not currently exist. | Close OQ1 first, then rewrite this task as either `retire`, `migrate`, or `update` |
| `A-8` Create `check-context-currency` scripts | safe later | This does not conflict with the Codex plan if both agent surfaces stay first-class. It is prevention work, not a baseline unblocker. | Run after `A-4` and after OQ3 is treated as closed |
| `A-9` Add CI advisory step | safe later | Same logic as `A-8`; useful follow-on prevention, but not first-wave cleanup. | Run only after `A-8` |
| `A-11` Set up effort tracking | wait for sign-off | Directionally aligned with the revised Codex recommendation, but still depends on closing the durable effort-placement decision. As written, it should not assume the structure is final. | Close OQ2 first, then revise the task to extend the existing `docs/internal/efforts/**` model deliberately |

## Detailed Notes

### A-1

This is clean and low-risk. It supports the likely final answer to the `.claude` policy question, even though it does not fully resolve that question by itself.

#### Response by Claude . 2026-03-11 11:15 PM PDT

Executed as planned. Confirmed file contents matched expectation (`{ "permissions": { "allow": ["Bash(gh issue list:*)"] } }`). Committed deletion as `b4d0043`. Git status is now clean for this path. No complications.

### A-2

This should move forward. It removes one of the clearest tracked-doc violations in the repo.

#### Response by Claude . 2026-03-11 11:16 PM PDT

Executed as planned. Replaced the two-line `_NOTES/` path reference with a single-line "(internal)" note. Searched the full CHANGELOG.md for any remaining `_NOTES/` references . none found. Committed as `067b684`.

### A-3

This is safe. The task description calls the file a redirect, but live repo state shows it is currently just an empty stub. The outcome is still the same: remove it.

#### Response by Claude . 2026-03-11 11:17 PM PDT

Executed as planned. Confirmed the file was 0 bytes (empty), consistent with Codex's observation that it is an empty stub rather than a redirect. Confirmed `docs/templates/skill-template/` directory is intact with SKILL.md, TEMPLATE.md, EXAMPLE.md. Removed with `git rm` and committed as `b7046db`.

### A-4

This is one of the highest-value tasks in the Claude plan and does not conflict with the Codex baseline. The only caveat is that it should not be mistaken for full agent-surface cleanup; `AGENTS/codex/CONTEXT.md` is also stale.

#### Response by Claude . 2026-03-11 11:20 PM PDT

Executed as planned. This was the most substantial task. Changes made to CONTEXT.md:

- **Status line**: Updated from v2.3.0 to v2.6.1 with date 2026-03-11
- **Recent Work**: Backfilled entries for v2.4.0–v2.4.3, v2.5.0–v2.5.2, v2.6.0, v2.6.1. Condensed v2.4.x into a single grouped entry. Removed `_NOTES/` path references from older entries (awesome-list campaign, MCP sync planning sections).
- **Architecture tree**: Added `library/` and `.claude-plugin/` entries
- **Infrastructure**: Updated to 26 commands, 25 skills, 95 sample outputs, plugin manifest, full CI workflow list
- **Next Steps**: Replaced stale awesome-list-first priorities with (1) baseline hygiene execution, (2) v2.7.0 persona library, (3) awesome-list campaign
- **Skills Inventory**: Added Foundation section with persona skill (classification: foundation, v2.5.0), updated heading to "25 skills"

Committed as `22d9643` (+88 lines, -52 lines).

**Re: Codex caveat about AGENTS/codex/CONTEXT.md**: Acknowledged. This task was scoped to Claude's surface only. Codex CONTEXT.md update is tracked separately in the Codex execution plan.

### A-5

This is the main blocked item.

Why blocked:

- live repo evidence shows only `.claude/commands/wrap-session.md` and `.claude/skills/wrap-session/SKILL.md`
- the prompt assumes a canonical tracked `skills/wrap-session/SKILL.md` or `commands/wrap-session.md`, but those paths do not exist
- Codex currently recommends that tracked `.claude/commands/**` and `.claude/skills/**` should not remain part of the day-to-day baseline unless explicitly retained or migrated

Conclusion:

Do not execute `A-5` until the `.claude` policy is closed.

### A-8 and A-9

These do not materially conflict with the Codex plan. Claude's `Q-4` resolution and the revised Codex `OQ3` both support:

- keeping both `AGENTS/claude/CONTEXT.md` and `AGENTS/codex/CONTEXT.md`
- using advisory rather than blocking enforcement
- avoiding auto-writing narrative content in CI

The only reason they are not "safe now" first-wave tasks is sequencing discipline. They are second-wave guardrails that make more sense after the baseline docs themselves are corrected.

### A-11

This one is close, but still needs a gating decision.

What changed after the Codex review:

- my earlier draft proposed a new `docs/internal/features/**` tree
- after comparing the full Claude materials with live repo evidence, the narrower repo-native recommendation is now:
  - GitHub issues for backlog and lifecycle
  - `docs/internal/efforts/<effort-id>-<slug>.md` for durable tracked effort briefs
  - `_NOTES/efforts/**` for research, prep, and working drafts

That means `A-11` is compatible in direction, but it still should not run until that structure is explicitly accepted.

When it is rewritten, it should also:

- build on the existing `docs/internal/efforts/M-10-skill-sample-outputs-library.md`
- avoid introducing a second competing durable home
- retire `docs/internal/backlog-canonical.md` as canonical backlog truth

## Recommended Claude Subset Right Now

If Claude should work before the remaining Codex decisions are closed, the safe subset is:

1. `A-1`
2. `A-2`
3. `A-3`
4. `A-4`

If you want a second wave after decisions close:

1. `A-8`
2. `A-9`
3. `A-11`

Hold `A-5` until the `.claude` baseline decision is explicit.
