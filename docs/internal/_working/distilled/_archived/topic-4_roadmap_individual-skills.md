### 1.2 Existing Bundles (3 Workflows)

| Bundle | Skills Chained | Coverage |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| feature-kickoff | problem-statement → hypothesis → prd → user-stories → launch-checklist | Core feature delivery |
| triple-diamond | Full 6-phase sequence | Complete lifecycle |
| lean-startup | hypothesis → experiment-design → experiment-results → pivot-decision | Rapid validation |

## 2. Evaluation Framework

Each skill is evaluated across 7 dimensions:

| Dimension | Description | Scale |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Value** | How much does this help PMs make better decisions? | 1-5 (5 = critical) |
| **Need** | How often do PMs encounter this task? | 1-5 (5 = daily) |
| **Frequency** | How often would this skill be invoked per project? | 1-5 (5 = multiple times) |
| **Complexity** | How hard is the task without AI assistance? | 1-5 (5 = very hard) |
| **Token/Context** | How token-efficient is the skill? | 1-5 (5 = very efficient) |
| **Differentiation** | How unique is this vs. general Claude capability? | 1-5 (5 = highly unique) |
| **Ecosystem Fit** | How well does this integrate with existing skills? | 1-5 (5 = perfect fit) |

**Priority Score** = (Value × 2) + Need + Frequency + Complexity + Token + Differentiation + Ecosystem

## 4. Existing Skills: Improvement Priorities

### 4.1 Highest-Impact Improvements

| Skill | Improvement | Value | Effort |
|-------|-------------|-------|--------|
| `deliver-prd` | Add quick mode for simple features | High | Low |
| `deliver-prd` | Add revision mode (update existing PRD) | Very High | Medium |
| `deliver-user-stories` | Auto-detect PRD and load as context | High | Medium |
| `foundation-persona` | Add persona library integration | Medium | Medium |
| `discover-competitive-analysis` | Add web search integration (agent) | High | Medium |
| `iterate-retrospective` | Add team sentiment analysis | Medium | Low |
| `measure-experiment-design` | Add power analysis framework | Medium | Low |

### 4.2 Convention Alignment Pass

All 25 skills should be audited against current conventions:

| Check | Likely Issues | Effort |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Frontmatter completeness | Older skills may lack `metadata.frameworks` | Low |
| Description quality | Some descriptions may be too short or vague | Low |
| TEMPLATE.md guidance comments | Older templates may lack inline guidance | Medium |
| EXAMPLE.md completeness | Some examples may be truncated | Medium |
| Output contract presence | Older skills may lack explicit output contracts | Medium |

This audit is exactly what `/skill-builder audit` would do . another reason to build the skill-builder first.

## 5. Phase Coverage Analysis

### 5.1 Coverage Heat Map

```
Phase      Core Tasks     Skills  Coverage  Gaps
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Discover   Research,       3/5    ████░░    survey analysis,

                                            doc-updater
```

### 5.2 Key Finding

**The biggest value gap is in Utility and Foundation skills**, not in the domain phases. The domain phases are 70-90% covered for core PM tasks. The utility infrastructure (project management, document updates, skill building) is 0% covered and would multiply the value of everything else.

**Implication**: Build utility skills before adding more domain skills.
