## 1. GSD-Compatible Project Specification

The GSD (Get Shit Done) framework uses a `.planning/` directory with phased execution. Here's how a pm-skills project workspace maps to GSD conventions while extending them for multi-project PM work.

### 1.1 GSD-Style Project Structure

```

# Project Manager

## Purpose

Help PMs organize and navigate multiple concurrent product initiatives. Each
project groups PM artifacts (problem statements, PRDs, user stories, etc.) in
a persistent directory structure that survives across sessions and platforms.

## When to Use

- Starting a new product initiative
- Switching context between projects mid-session
- Reviewing what artifacts exist for a project
- Checking which projects need attention
- Loading project context before running another pm-skill

## When NOT to Use

- For a single, one-off artifact (just run the skill directly)
- For software project planning (use GSD or similar)
- For task/ticket management (use Linear, Jira, etc.)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify the Action

Ask the user what they need:

| Action | When to Use |
|--------|------------|
| **Create project** | Starting a new initiative |
| **Switch project** | Changing context to a different initiative |
| **List projects** | Seeing all active projects |
| **View status** | Understanding current state of a project |
| **Load context** | Preparing to run another pm-skill with project context |
| **Archive project** | Moving a completed/cancelled project out of active list |

### Step 2: Execute the Action

#### Create Project

1. Ask for project name (will be converted to kebab-case for directory)
2. Ask clarifying questions:
   - What is the objective? (1-2 sentences)
   - What phase is this starting in? (discover/define/develop/deliver/measure/iterate)
   - Who are the key stakeholders?
   - What constraints or deadlines exist?
3. Create the project directory structure
4. Generate PROJECT.md from template
5. Update PROJECT_INDEX.md
6. Set as active project

#### Switch Project

1. Read PROJECT_INDEX.md for available projects
2. Switch active project in .pm-config.yaml
3. Display brief project status

#### List Projects

1. Read PROJECT_INDEX.md
2. Display table with: project name, phase, status, artifact count, last active date
3. Highlight the active project

#### View Status

1. Read active project's PROJECT.md
2. Scan artifacts/ directory for existing documents
3. Check links.yaml for relationships (if exists)
4. Check for stale documents (>14 days without update)
5. Present:
   - Project overview
   - Artifact inventory by phase
   - Suggested next skills to run
   - Any stale or missing artifacts

#### Load Context

1. Read active project's PROJECT.md
2. Identify the most relevant artifacts (based on what skill the user plans to run)
3. Output context in a format suitable for copy-paste into the next skill invocation
4. Keep output under 2000 tokens

#### Archive Project

1. Move project directory to _archived/
2. Remove from PROJECT_INDEX.md active list
3. Add to archived section

### Step 3: Suggest Next Steps

After any action, suggest relevant follow-up:
- After create: "Run /problem-statement to define the core problem"
- After switch: "Run /project status to see where you left off"
- After status: "Based on your phase, consider running /[next-skill]"

## Output Contract

- Project directory structure matches the specification in TEMPLATE.md
- PROJECT.md follows the template schema
- All file names are kebab-case
- Phase directories are one of: discover, define, develop, deliver, measure, iterate
- PROJECT_INDEX.md is updated on every project create/archive/status change
```

# Acme Checkout Redesign

## Objective
Reduce mobile checkout abandonment from 73% to under 55% by simplifying
the checkout flow for returning users. This directly impacts Q2 revenue
targets and NPS scores.

## Key Constraints
- Must not break existing Stripe payment integration
- Mobile-first design (60% of checkout traffic is mobile)
- Q2 2026 launch target (April 30 deadline)
- Budget: 2 engineers + 1 designer for 6 weeks

## Current State
- Discovery complete: 4 user interviews conducted, competitive analysis done
- Problem statement and hypothesis validated by stakeholder review
- PRD v1 drafted, pending engineering review
- User stories: 5 of 12 drafted

## Open Questions
- Should guest checkout be in v1 scope? (Lisa leans yes, engineering says no)
- Can we reuse the existing address autocomplete component?

## 5. Command Specification Examples

### 5.1 /project Command (GSD-Compatible)

```yaml
---
name: project
description: >-
  Manage PM project workspaces. Supports: new, switch, list, status,
  context, archive. Persists project state across sessions using a local
  directory structure compatible with GSD and agentskills.io conventions.
arguments:
  - name: action
    description: "new | switch | list | status | context | archive"
    required: true
  - name: name
    description: "Project name (kebab-case)"
    required: false
---

# /project

Manage your PM project workspace.

## Usage

- `/project new <name>` . Create a new project with guided setup
- `/project switch <name>` . Switch active project context
- `/project list` . Show all projects with status
- `/project status` . Detailed view of active project
- `/project context` . Output project context for use with other skills
- `/project archive <name>` . Archive a completed or cancelled project

## Behavior

When creating a new project, ask these questions:
1. What is this project's objective? (1-2 sentences)
2. What phase are you starting in? (default: discover)
3. Who are the key stakeholders? (name + role)
4. What constraints or deadlines exist?
5. Any relevant tags?

Create the project directory structure, generate PROJECT.md, and set
as active project.

When switching projects, load the PROJECT.md and display a brief status
summary so the PM knows where they left off.

## Output

All project operations produce human-readable output. No JSON, no raw YAML.
Tables and ASCII progress bars for status displays.
```

### 5.2 /update-doc Command (Open-Spec Compatible)

```yaml
---
name: update-doc
description: >-
  Intelligently update an existing PM artifact with new information.
  Preserves document structure, creates versioned copies, and tracks
  provenance of changes. Works with any artifact in the active project.
arguments:
  - name: artifact
    description: "Artifact to update (e.g., prd, problem-statement, user-stories)"
    required: true
  - name: source
    description: "Source of new information (file path, or 'conversation' for inline)"
    required: false
---

# /update-doc

Update an existing PM artifact with new information while preserving
its structure and creating a version history.

## Usage

- `/update-doc prd` . Update the PRD with information from conversation
- `/update-doc problem-statement --with inputs/interview-2026-03-20.md` . Update based on transcript
- `/update-doc hypothesis --with artifacts/discover/experiment-results.md` . Update based on results

## Behavior

1. Find the most recent version of the artifact in the active project
2. Read the current content
3. Accept new information (from conversation, file, or user input)
4. Produce updated version:
   - Same sections, same structure
   - New information integrated at appropriate locations
   - Conflicts or contradictions flagged for user review
   - Frontmatter updated (version incremented, date updated)
5. Save as new version (e.g., prd_v2.md)
6. Record change in .history/ with:
   - What changed (diff summary)
   - Why (source of new information)
   - When (timestamp)
```

# Insight Report: User Interview #4 . Returning Customer (Maria, 34)

## Summary
Maria is a frequent shopper (2-3x/month) who primarily uses mobile. She
confirmed the checkout pain hypothesis but added a nuance: the problem
isn't just *steps* but *redundant data entry*. She enters the same address
and payment info every time despite being logged in.

## Extracted Insights

### Insight 1: Redundant Data Entry is the Core Pain
> "I'm logged in. You know my address. Why am I typing it again?"
- **Relevance**: Directly validates hypothesis
- **Affects**: define/problem-statement.md (Section: User Impact)
- **Suggested update**: Add "redundant data entry for returning users" as primary pain

### Insight 2: Trust Barrier with Saved Payment
> "I saved my card once but I wasn't sure it was actually saved. The page
> looked the same as for new customers."
- **Relevance**: New finding . UX signal for saved state is unclear
- **Affects**: develop/prd_v1.md (Section: Requirements)
- **Suggested update**: Add requirement "Clear visual indicator for saved payment methods"

### Insight 3: Address Auto-Fill Works But Feels Risky
> "It autofilled my old address once. I almost shipped $200 of stuff to
> my college apartment."
- **Relevance**: Edge case for address management
- **Affects**: deliver/user-stories.md (new story needed)
- **Suggested update**: Add story "As a returning user, I want to verify my
  shipping address before purchase so that I don't accidentally ship to an
  old address"

### Insight 4: Mobile Keyboard Switching is Painful
> "On my phone, switching between letter keyboard and number keyboard for
> the ZIP code... I just give up sometimes."
- **Relevance**: Mobile-specific UX pain
- **Affects**: develop/prd_v1.md (Section: Technical Considerations)
- **Suggested update**: Add "Use numeric keyboard for ZIP/CVV fields on mobile"

### Insight 5: Guest Checkout Preference for Gifts
> "When I'm buying a gift and shipping to someone else, I don't want my
> address saved. I just want to type theirs and go."
- **Relevance**: Informs guest checkout scope decision
- **Affects**: PROJECT.md (Open Questions section)
- **Suggested update**: Guest checkout may be needed for gift-shipping use case

### Insight 6: Positive Signal on Single-Page Concept
> "If I could just see my saved stuff and hit 'buy'? That would be amazing."
- **Relevance**: Validates single-page approach
- **Affects**: define/hypothesis.md (validation evidence)
- **Suggested update**: Add as validation evidence (4/4 users now positive)

## Suggested Actions

| Priority | Action | Artifact | Type |
|----------|--------|----------|------|
| 1 | Update problem statement with redundant data entry framing | problem-statement.md | Update |
| 2 | Add saved payment visibility requirement to PRD | prd_v1.md | Update |
| 3 | Add address verification user story | user-stories.md | New content |
| 4 | Add mobile keyboard requirement to PRD | prd_v1.md | Update |
| 5 | Document gift-shipping guest checkout insight | PROJECT.md | Update |
| 6 | Record validation evidence on hypothesis | hypothesis.md | Update |
