**Why notable**: Closest analog to what pm-skills could become. Solves context rot via fresh-context subagent spawning. `.planning/` state management, milestone-driven lifecycle, wave-based parallel execution.
**Limitation**: Single-project-per-repo, developer-oriented (not PM).
**Learn from**: STATE.md pattern, discuss→plan→execute→verify lifecycle, milestone archiving, `seeds/` and `threads/` concepts.
