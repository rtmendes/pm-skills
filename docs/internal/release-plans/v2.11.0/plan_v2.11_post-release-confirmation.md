# v2.11.0 Post-Release Confirmation

**Tag created**: 2026-04-18
**Type**: Feature release (minor). Meeting Skills Family + Lean Canvas

Authoritative record that v2.11.0 actually shipped. Complements the in-progress-state artifacts (`plan_v2.11.0.md`, `plan_v2.11_codex-review.md`, `plan_v2.11_review-journal.md`, etc.) by recording what happened at tag time and what was verified post-tag.

## Branch-protection observation

Push to `main` reported: *"Bypassed rule violations for refs/heads/main: Changes must be made through a pull request."*

The push succeeded because the committer has bypass rights on `main`. This is expected for maintainer release commits, but worth noting as a process observation:

- **Current practice**: direct-to-main release commits with pre-push validation and Codex adversarial review
- **PR-based alternative**: create a release branch, open a PR against main, let CI run the full validation suite in CI environment, merge after review
- **Tradeoff**: PR path is more transparent (review findings visible in PR UI) and exercises CI against the actual merge-base, but adds latency to release cutting; direct-to-main with local validation + Codex review is faster but depends on local state matching CI

**Recommendation**: consider the PR path for v2.12.0 given the sample-automation scope and the adversarial-review-loop now being codified. Track as process-improvement note, not a hard switch.

## What shipped

### Skills (6 new foundation)

| Effort | Skill | Command |
|--------|-------|---------|
| F-26 | `foundation-lean-canvas` | `/lean-canvas` |
| F-18 | `foundation-meeting-agenda` | `/meeting-agenda` |
| F-25 | `foundation-meeting-brief` | `/meeting-brief` |
| F-27 | `foundation-meeting-recap` | `/meeting-recap` |
| F-17 | `foundation-meeting-synthesize` | `/meeting-synthesize` |

### Infrastructure

- **Meeting Skills Family Contract v1.1.0** at `docs/reference/skill-families/meeting-skills-contract.md`
- **New directory pattern** `docs/reference/skill-families/` with landing-page index
- **Enforcing CI** `scripts/validate-meeting-skills-family.sh` + `.ps1` + `.md`, wired into `.github/workflows/validation.yml`

### Samples

15 thread-aligned library samples (3 per meeting skill × storevine / brainshelf / workbench). Library total grew 94 → 120.

### Documentation

- **End-user guide**: `docs/guides/using-meeting-skills.md` (3 mermaid diagrams)
- **Release notes**: `docs/releases/Release_v2.11.0.md`
- **5 release-plan companion docs**: plan, codex-review, ci-coverage-analysis, pre-release-checklist, review-journal
- **v2.12.0 backlog stub**: `docs/internal/release-plans/v2.12.0/plan_v2.12.0.md`

### Counts

| Metric | v2.10.2 | v2.11.0 | Delta |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| Total skills | 32 | 38 | +6 |
| Phase skills | 25 | 25 | 0 |
| Foundation skills | 1 | 7 | +6 |
| Utility skills | 6 | 6 | 0 |
| Slash commands | 39 | 45 | +6 |
| Library samples | 94 | 120 | +26 |
| Skill-family contracts | 0 | 1 | +1 |
| CI scripts | 15 | 16 | +1 |

## Post-tag verification (to complete)

These happen in GitHub's environment after the push; track here for maintainer visibility.

### GitHub Actions workflows

Expected to run on the push:
- [ ] `validation.yml`. full validator matrix (Ubuntu + Windows, bash + pwsh)
- [ ] `deploy-docs.yml`. mkdocs site deploy with new v2.11.0 pages (if configured to deploy on tag or main-push)
- [ ] `release.yml`. release artifact generation (if configured to trigger on tag)
- [ ] `release-zips.yml`. release zip generation (if configured to trigger on tag)
- [ ] `sync-agents-md.yml`. AGENTS.md sync (if configured)
- [ ] `validate-mcp-sync.yml`. MCP sync check (advisory; pm-skills-mcp is frozen per M-22)
- [ ] `validate-plugin.yml`. plugin manifest validation

**Confirmation to run post-tag**: check the Actions tab at `https://github.com/product-on-purpose/pm-skills/actions` for green status on the v2.11.0 commit. Any failure there that didn't surface locally indicates a local-vs-CI environment difference worth tracking.

### GitHub Release

Not auto-created by the tag push alone. To create:

```bash
gh release create v2.11.0 \
  --title "v2.11.0. Meeting Skills Family + Lean Canvas" \
  --notes-file docs/releases/Release_v2.11.0.md
```

Or via the web UI: Tags → v2.11.0 → Create release from tag → paste contents of `docs/releases/Release_v2.11.0.md` into body.

### Docs site (MkDocs)

If `deploy-docs.yml` deploys on main-push (or on tag), verify the new pages appear at the published URL:
- `/reference/skill-families/` (landing)
- `/reference/skill-families/meeting-skills-contract/`
- `/guides/using-meeting-skills/`
- `/skills/foundation/foundation-meeting-agenda/` through `/foundation-stakeholder-update/`
- `/releases/Release_v2.11.0/`

### Plugin marketplace

`marketplace.json` v2.11.0 description is now live. If pm-skills is listed in any external plugin registries, those may need a manual refresh depending on how they consume `marketplace.json`.

## Adversarial-review outcomes that shaped this release

Two rounds of Codex adversarial review across the session:

| Round | Findings | CRITICAL | IMPORTANT | MINOR | NIT | Resolved in-session | Deferred |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------|-------|-----|---------------------|----------|
| 1 | 15 | 3 | 7 | 3 | 1 | 14 | 1 (R1-I8 → F-31 in v2.12.0) |
| 2 | 11 | 0 | 6 | 3 | 2 | 10 | 1 (R2-M2. resolved in final pass before tag) |

**Zero CRITICAL or IMPORTANT findings open at tag time.** Full narrative: `plan_v2.11_review-journal.md`.

## What's next

### Immediate

- Monitor GitHub Actions on the v2.11.0 commit for green status
- Create GitHub Release from the tag (optional but recommended for changelog visibility)
- Verify docs site deployment picks up new pages

### Short-term (next 2-4 weeks)

- Collect real-world usage signals on meeting-skills for F-29 / F-30 design locks (v2.12.0)
- Watch for any post-release bug reports or usage friction
- If stylistic refinement surfaces as a real pain point, consider v2.11.1 patch; otherwise fold any tweaks into v2.12.0

### v2.12.0 planning (when signals are sufficient)

7 efforts in the stub:
1. F-34 THREAD_PROFILES.md (prerequisite; start here)
2. F-32 pm-skill-builder sample generation (blocks on F-34)
3. F-31 pm-skill-validate family + sample awareness (parallel to F-32)
4. F-33 check-sample-standards CI (parallel)
5. F-35 pm-skill-iterate sample regeneration (blocks on F-31 + F-32)
6. F-29 meeting-lifecycle workflow (real-world-usage-informed)
7. F-30 family-adoption guide (real-world-usage-informed)

Re-run Phase 0 Adversarial Review Loop before v2.12.0 tag. now canonical in the pre-release checklist.
