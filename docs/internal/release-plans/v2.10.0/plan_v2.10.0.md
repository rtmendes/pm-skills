# v2.10.0 Release Plan — Utility & Skill Expansion

Status: In Progress
Owner: Maintainers
Type: Feature release (minor)

## Release Theme

**Skill expansion + self-service** — new utility and domain skills expanding
the pm-skills library beyond 30 skills, plus a self-update skill that lets
users keep their installation current.

---

## Context

The pm-skills library currently has 31 skills (25 phase skills across 6
Triple Diamond phases, 1 foundation skill, and 5 utility skills). v2.10.0
adds new skills and capabilities, including the library's first meta-skill
(self-updater).

v2.9.1 (D-05 workflows guide + M-20 docs count CI) ships first as a patch.
v2.10.0 follows as the next minor release with new user-facing skill content.

## Decisions

| Decision | Answer | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Version** | **v2.10.0** (minor) | New user-facing skills = new capability. Follows SemVer convention. |
| **Dependency on v2.9.1** | **Yes — v2.9.1 ships first** | D-05 (workflows guide) and M-20 (docs count CI) must land before v2.10.0. The new CI from M-20 will validate skill counts in this release. |
| **F-16 skill classification** | **utility** (no phase) | Mermaid diagrams are cross-cutting — PMs use them at every phase. Not tied to a specific Triple Diamond stage. |
| **F-24 skill classification** | **utility** (no phase) | Self-update is cross-cutting infrastructure, not tied to a Triple Diamond stage. |
| **F-24 local state directory** | **`_pm-skills/`** (underscore prefix) | Visible on macOS/Windows (unlike dot-prefix). Consistent with `_workflows/`, `_NOTES/` conventions. Added to `.gitignore`. |
| **Skill count after all efforts** | **32+ skills** | F-16 (shipped) + F-19 (shipped) + F-24 (ready) = 32 minimum. F-17/F-18 would bring to 34 if they ship. |
| **MCP parity** | **TBD** | Determine whether pm-skills-mcp needs corresponding tools for new skills. Note: F-24 (update skill) may not be suitable for MCP (requires network + file writes). |
| **Additional efforts** | **TBD** | F-17, F-18 are candidates. Release scope may expand further. |

| P2 | Add `_pm-skills/` to `.gitignore` | Not started |

#### New CI for F-24

| Script | Purpose | Mode |
|--------|---------|------|
| `scripts/validate-gitignore-pm-skills.sh` + `.ps1` | Ensure `_pm-skills/` stays in `.gitignore` | Advisory initially |
| `scripts/validate-update-report-template.sh` + `.ps1` | Validate TEMPLATE.md has required sections | Advisory initially |

### Remaining docs hygiene (at release time)

- [ ] CHANGELOG.md v2.10.0 entry (F-16 + F-19 + F-24 + any others)
- [ ] `docs/concepts/versioning.md` utility skill count (historical context)
- [ ] Internal mkdocs planning docs (stale counts, non-public)
- [ ] Generate skill pages via `scripts/generate-skill-pages.py`
- [ ] skills-manifest.yaml for v2.10.0

## CI That Applies

| Workflow | Checks | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `lint-skills-frontmatter` | Frontmatter consistency for new skills | Must pass |
| `validate-commands` | Command file references valid skill | Must pass |
| `validate-agents-md` | AGENTS.md ↔ skill directory sync | Must pass |
| `check-mcp-impact` | Advisory — flags MCP-relevant changes | Advisory only |
| `docs-count-consistency` (M-20) | Skill counts match across README, getting-started, AGENTS.md | Must pass (ships in v2.9.1) |
| `validate-version-consistency` (new, F-24) | `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` versions match | Must pass |
| `validate-gitignore-pm-skills` (new, F-24) | `_pm-skills/` in `.gitignore` | Advisory initially |

---

## MCP Impact

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| User-facing API changes? | **Yes** — 2-3 new MCP tools from shipped/ready skills |
| New MCP tools needed? | **Yes** — `pm_mermaid_diagrams` (F-16), `pm_slideshow_creator` (F-19). F-24 (`pm_update_pm_skills`) TBD — may not be suitable for MCP (requires network + file writes). |
| Separate MCP release required? | **Yes** — pm-skills-mcp needs embed + build + publish |
| Code changes needed? | **Minimal** — update `src/config.ts` description count only. Skill loading, tool registration, and resource URIs are all auto-discovered. |

### MCP Alignment Steps (future session)

1. Run `npm run embed-skills` in pm-skills-mcp to copy new skills from pm-skills repo
2. Update `src/config.ts` description: skill count 27 → current total
3. Decide whether to include `utility-update-pm-skills` in MCP embed (may exclude — requires network + file writes)
4. `npm run build` and verify new tools appear
5. Version bump pm-skills-mcp package.json
6. Publish / deploy

**Current gap:** pm-skills-mcp has 28 embedded skills; pm-skills repo has 31+. The MCP server is multiple skills behind.

## Verification Plan

### F-16 verification (complete)

```powershell
# All passed on 2026-04-07
scripts/validate-commands.ps1          # 37/37 OK
scripts/validate-agents-md.ps1         # 30 paths matched
```

### F-19 verification (complete)

```powershell
# All passed on 2026-04-08
scripts/validate-commands.ps1          # 38/38 OK
scripts/validate-agents-md.ps1         # 31 paths matched
```

### F-24 verification (pending)

```powershell
# Run after promoting drafts to canonical locations
scripts/lint-skills-frontmatter.ps1    # utility-update-pm-skills frontmatter
scripts/validate-commands.ps1          # update-pm-skills.md references valid skill
scripts/validate-agents-md.ps1         # AGENTS.md includes new entry
scripts/validate-gitignore-pm-skills.ps1  # _pm-skills/ in .gitignore (new)
```

### Before tagging

- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] `mkdocs build --strict` — zero warnings
- [ ] Skill counts consistent across all files
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry written
- [ ] `_pm-skills/` in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` versions match
- [ ] No references to `docs/internal/` in shipped skill content
- [ ] F-24 acceptance criteria spot-checked (run `/update-pm-skills --report-only` manually)

## Open Questions

1. **Additional efforts for v2.10.0** — Should F-17 (Meeting Synthesis) or F-18 (Meeting Prep) be pulled in, or defer to v2.11.0?
2. **MCP for F-24** — Does `pm_update_pm_skills` make sense as an MCP tool? Requires network + file writes which MCP may not support. May need to be excluded from embed.
3. **User-facing guide** — Should `docs/guides/updating-pm-skills.md` ship with the skill or be deferred?
4. **Final skill count** — Depends on which additional efforts land.
