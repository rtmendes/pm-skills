## Release Theme

Infrastructure hardening (M-12) + release packaging hygiene (M-16) + first new skill since v2.6 (F-06) + meta-tooling for skill creation (F-05) + documentation refresh (D-01, D-02). This release makes the repo easier to extend, keeps internal governance docs out of user-facing ZIPs, adds a practical Deliver-phase skill, and ensures public docs reflect the current state.

## Gating Criteria

- [x] M-12 committed and CI green
- [x] F-06 committed and CI green (must pass M-12's enhanced validation)
- [x] M-16 committed and release ZIP excludes `docs/internal/**` while preserving public docs
- [x] F-05 design approved and implemented
- [x] F-05 committed and local validators pass (`lint-skills-frontmatter`, `validate-commands`, `validate-agents-md`)
- [x] D-01: `docs/pm-skill-anatomy.md` created
- [x] D-02: Public-facing docs reviewed and updated for the post-`a67f144` repo state
- [x] CHANGELOG.md updated with v2.7.0 section
- [x] Local enhanced validation passes for 27 skills, 28 command docs, and 27 `AGENTS.md` skill entries
- [ ] Tag `v2.7.0` pushed → release.yml fires → ZIP published

## Documentation Tasks (D-01, D-02)

### D-01: Skill Anatomy Document

Create `docs/pm-skill-anatomy.md` — a public-facing guide explaining the architecture and anatomy of a pm-skills skill. Should cover:
- Directory structure (`skills/{phase}-{name}/SKILL.md` + `references/`)
- Frontmatter schema and field meanings
- SKILL.md section structure (Instructions, Output Contract, Quality Checklist)
- TEMPLATE.md and EXAMPLE.md roles
- Classification types (domain, foundation, utility)
- How skills relate to commands, bundles, and AGENTS.md
- The Triple Diamond phase model

This document supports F-05 (the builder references skill anatomy concepts) and helps new contributors understand what they're building.

### D-02: Public Docs Review

Review and update these files for v2.7.0 accuracy:

| File | Review focus |
|------|-------------|
| `docs/guides/*` | Do guides reflect current skill count (27), current command-doc count (28), new CI scripts, utility skills, and `/pm-skill-builder`? |
| `docs/reference/*` | Are reference docs current with frontmatter schema, classification types? |
| `docs/templates/skill-template/*` | Does the skill template match what the builder produces? |
| `docs/agent-skill-anatomy.md` | Is this the file D-01 should replace/extend? Check for overlap with planned `docs/pm-skill-anatomy.md` |
| `docs/getting-started.md` | Does it mention `/pm-skill-builder`? Are counts and AGENTS discovery notes current? |
| `scripts/README_SCRIPTS.md` | Does it document the 3 new M-12 scripts? |
| `QUICKSTART.md` | Updated for 27 skills and 28 command docs, including `/pm-skill-builder`? |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | v2.7.0 section needed at tag time |

## Notes

1. M-12 and F-06 were built by Codex 5.4, reviewed by Claude Opus 4.6.
2. F-05 design was reviewed by Codex, fixes applied by Claude, and implementation landed across `3c50108`, `df794a1`, and `a67f144`.
3. One workflow fix applied during review: duplicate steps removed from `validation.yml`.
4. M-16 was created from the F-05 staging/release-packaging review and landed as `0c2e637`.
5. Fresh local release verification on 2026-03-22 confirmed `docs/internal/**` is excluded from `dist/pm-skills-v2.7.0.zip` while public files like `QUICKSTART.md` remain included.
6. D-02 public-doc edits were started before the `/pm-skill-builder` command and `AGENTS.md` entry landed in `a67f144`; a short follow-up pass is still needed so public docs reflect the final F-05 state.
7. D-01 remains planned. `docs/agent-skill-anatomy.md` now carries a scope note so it can complement, not duplicate, the future `docs/pm-skill-anatomy.md`.

## Review Requests

- Claude: review F-05 user experience and content quality for `utility-pm-skill-builder` before tag.
- Codex: run the D-02 follow-up pass after F-05 wiring so public docs reflect `/pm-skill-builder`, 28 command docs, and 27 `AGENTS.md` entries.
- Human: confirm D-01 still belongs in `v2.7.0`; if not, explicitly de-scope it before release prep.
