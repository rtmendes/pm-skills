## Release Theme

Infrastructure hardening (M-12) + release packaging hygiene (M-16) + first new skill since v2.6 (F-06) + meta-tooling for skill creation (F-05) + documentation refresh (D-01, D-02). This release makes the repo easier to extend, keeps internal governance docs out of user-facing ZIPs, adds a practical Deliver-phase skill, and ensures public docs reflect the current state.

## Gating Criteria

- [x] M-12 committed and CI green
- [x] F-06 committed and CI green (must pass M-12's enhanced validation)
- [x] M-16 committed and release ZIP excludes `docs/internal/**` while preserving public docs
- [x] F-05 design approved and implemented
- [x] F-05 committed and CI green
- [ ] D-01: `docs/skill-anatomy.md` created
- [ ] D-02: Public-facing docs reviewed and updated for v2.7.0 accuracy
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with v2.7.0 section
- [ ] All 27+ skills pass enhanced CI validation
- [ ] Tag `v2.7.0` pushed → release.yml fires → ZIP published

## Documentation Tasks (D-01, D-02)

### D-01: Skill Anatomy Document

Create `docs/skill-anatomy.md` — a public-facing guide explaining the architecture and anatomy of a pm-skills skill. Should cover:
- Directory structure (`skills/{phase}-{name}/SKILL.md` + `references/`)
- Frontmatter schema and field meanings
- SKILL.md section structure (Instructions, Output Contract, Quality Checklist)
- TEMPLATE.md and EXAMPLE.md roles
- Classification types (domain, foundation, utility)
- How skills relate to commands, bundles, and AGENTS.md
- The Triple Diamond phase model

This document supports F-05 (the builder references skill anatomy concepts) and helps new contributors understand what they're building.

### D-02: Public Docs Review

Review and update these files for v2.7.0 accuracy:

| File | Review focus |
|------|-------------|
| `docs/guides/*` | Do guides reflect current skill count (27), new CI scripts, utility skills? |
| `docs/reference/*` | Are reference docs current with frontmatter schema, classification types? |
| `docs/templates/skill-template/*` | Does the skill template match what the builder produces? |
| `docs/agent-skill-anatomy.md` | Is this the file D-01 should replace/extend? Check for overlap |
| `docs/getting-started.md` | Does it mention the builder? Updated skill count? |
| `scripts/README_SCRIPTS.md` | Does it document the 3 new M-12 scripts? |
| `QUICKSTART.md` | Updated for 27 skills, new commands? |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | v2.7.0 section needed at tag time |

## Notes

1. M-12 and F-06 were built by Codex 5.4, reviewed by Claude Opus 4.6.
2. F-05 design was reviewed by Codex, fixes applied by Claude. Implementation is Claude-assigned.
3. One workflow fix applied during review: duplicate steps removed from `validation.yml`.
4. M-16 was created from the F-05 staging/release-packaging review and should land before the final `v2.7.0` cut.
5. M-16 is implemented locally and verified on both bash and PowerShell release packagers; commit still pending.
