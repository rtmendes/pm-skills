Status: Released  
Effort: `M-10-skill-sample-outputs-library`  
Release: v2.5.0  
Last updated: 2026-03-16

## Outcome

`M-10` closed aligned for `v2.5.0`. The sample library manifest was locked, release-matrix validation stayed green, and the shipped sample corpus remained aligned with the accepted behavior baseline at cut time.

## Tracked Evidence

1. `docs/internal/releases/v2.5.0/checklist.md` records the closed `M-10` gate and the release-matrix evidence block.
2. `library/skill-output-samples/manifest.v2.5.0.json` is the locked shipped manifest.
3. `docs/releases/Release_v2.5.0.md` captures the public release outcome.

## Validation Snapshot

1. `validate-commands` passed.
2. `lint-skills-frontmatter` passed.
3. `validate-mcp-sync` block mode passed against the release candidate refs.
4. `pm-skills-mcp` embed, build, and test checks passed on the paired release lane.
5. Corpus audit and content-alignment review closed without blocking defects for the shipped release.
