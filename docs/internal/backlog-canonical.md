# Backlog And Effort Entry Points

Status: Active
Owner: Maintainers
Last updated: 2026-03-22

GitHub issues are the canonical system for backlog and lifecycle state.

## Tracked Entry Points

1. `docs/internal/efforts/README.md` for the durable effort-brief model
2. `docs/internal/releases/README.md` for tracked release-governance artifacts

## Current Backlog (priority order)

Marketplace submission (Effort 0) is a human-only action, not an effort ID.

## Moved to Knowledge OS (2026-03-21)

| ID | Effort | Previous status |
|----|--------|----------------|
| M-01 | `/common` shared workspace | Deferred |
| M-02 | `/update-doc` command and skill | Deferred |
| M-03 | `/link-docs` command and skill | Deferred |
| M-04 | `/project` context workflow | Deferred |

These are now part of a separate Product on Purpose initiative (Knowledge OS). See `docs/internal/_working/knowledge/` for exploration docs.

## Operating Rules

1. Open, close, prioritize, and milestone work in GitHub issues.
2. Capture durable scope and canonical links in `docs/internal/efforts/<effort-id>-<slug>.md`.
3. Capture release-specific gating and closure artifacts in `docs/internal/releases/vX.Y.Z/**`.
4. Keep `_NOTES/**` as local working material, not canonical backlog state.
