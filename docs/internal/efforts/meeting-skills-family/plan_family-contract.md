# Meeting Skills Family — Authoring Plan

**Status**: In Progress (scaffolding phase)
**Owner**: Maintainers
**Started**: 2026-04-17
**Last updated**: 2026-04-17
**Type**: Cross-effort coordination (not an F-effort itself; coordinates F-17, F-18, F-25, F-27, F-28)
**Release target**: v2.11.0

## Quick resumption guide (read this first if picking up later)

If you are a future session picking up this work, start here:

1. **Read this doc top to bottom** — it is the source of truth for decisions, status, and next steps
2. **Check the File Inventory section** below to see what exists and what remains
3. **Check the Decisions Log section** to understand *why* choices were made
4. **Current phase** is shown in the Execution Phases section — pick up at the first `pending` row
5. **Canonical contract** lives at `docs/reference/skill-families/meeting-skills-contract.md` — read it before editing any individual skill
6. **Related docs**:
   - Two archived input notes: `docs/internal/_NOTES/archived-efforts/2026-04-17_foundation-meeting-skills-descriptions.md` + `..._templates.md` (the original design material)
   - Two archived original efforts: `docs/internal/_NOTES/archived-efforts/2026-04-17_F-17-meeting-synthesis-original.md` + `..._F-18-meeting-prep-original.md`
   - v2.11.0 release plan: `docs/internal/release-plans/v2.11.0/plan_v2.11.0.md` (coordinates F-26 + this family + M-22)

**What this plan does NOT cover**: actual authoring of the 5 SKILL.md / TEMPLATE.md / EXAMPLE.md files, the 5 slash command files, the 5+ library samples, and the 5 public skill doc pages. Those are **downstream execution**, tracked in each effort's own `plan_{slug}.md` inside its subfolder. This doc handles the scaffolding, contract, and cross-cutting CI.

---

## Purpose

Coordinate the authoring of a 5-skill `foundation-meeting-*` family that shares a common behavioral contract, frontmatter schema, file naming convention, and cross-skill CI enforcement. The family replaces narrower F-17 (meeting-synthesis) and F-18 (meeting-prep) efforts that were scoped before the expanded family design existed.

## Scope — the 5 skills

| ID | Skill directory | Command | Phase in lifecycle | Primary audience |
|----|----------------|---------|--------------------|------------------|
| F-18 (rewritten) | `skills/foundation-meeting-agenda/` | `/meeting-agenda` | Pre-meeting | Attendees |
| F-25 (new) | `skills/foundation-meeting-brief/` | `/meeting-brief` | Pre-meeting | User (private prep) |
| F-27 (new) | `skills/foundation-meeting-recap/` | `/meeting-recap` | Post-meeting | Attendees (actions inline) |
| F-17 (rewritten) | `skills/foundation-meeting-synthesize/` | `/meeting-synthesize` | Cross-meeting | User / leadership |
| F-28 (new) | `skills/foundation-stakeholder-update/` | `/stakeholder-update` | Post-meeting | Primarily non-attendees; secondarily some attendees |

All 5 classified as `foundation` phase — cross-cutting tooling that applies anywhere in the Triple Diamond lifecycle (consistent with `foundation-persona`, `foundation-lean-canvas` precedent).

## Decisions Log

Running log of decisions made across the session(s) that produced this plan. Add new decisions here as they are made; do not overwrite existing entries.

| # | Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | 2026-04-17 | All 5 skills classified `foundation-*` | Meeting skills are cross-cutting infrastructure, not Triple Diamond phase-specific. Matches `foundation-persona`, `foundation-lean-canvas` precedent. |
| 2 | 2026-04-17 | All 5 skills ship together in v2.11.0 | The family has shared contracts and cross-chain references (recap auto-populates from agenda, synthesize consumes recaps, stakeholder-update references recap). Staging breaks coherence. |
| 3 | 2026-04-17 | Effort brief format follows F-26 convention | F-16–F-23 batch uses a deprecated format with Quality Forecast zones. F-26 (lean-canvas) is the current convention: Scope / Problem / How It Works / Classification / Exemplars / Deliverables / Validation / Open Questions / Status Transitions / Detailed specification. |
| 4 | 2026-04-17 | F-17 archived and rewritten as `foundation-meeting-synthesize` (keeps ID) | Original F-17 was scoped narrower than the expanded family design. Salvage meeting type taxonomy + Krisp integration note + multi-meeting concept. |
| 5 | 2026-04-17 | F-18 archived and rewritten as `foundation-meeting-agenda` (keeps ID) | Original F-18 "meeting-prep" collapsed agenda + brief into one skill. New design splits these by audience (attendees vs. user-private). Salvage anti-meeting check + simplified RACI + "clarify objective" step; distribute to both agenda and brief. |
| 6 | 2026-04-17 | 3 new efforts: F-25 (brief), F-27 (recap), F-28 (stakeholder-update) | IDs chosen from registry gaps (F-25 was unused; F-27 and F-28 are next available after F-26 in-progress). |
| 7 | 2026-04-17 | Family contract lives at `docs/reference/skill-families/meeting-skills-contract.md` | Public, canonical, discoverable, enforced by CI. `docs/internal/` is for coordination material, not canonical contracts. Establishes `skill-families/` as a future-extensible pattern. |
| 8 | 2026-04-17 | Family authoring plan (this doc) lives at `docs/internal/efforts/meeting-skills-family/` | Named-slug effort folder handles meta-work coordinating multiple F-efforts; no F-number assigned because the family is not itself a shippable skill. |
| 9 | 2026-04-17 | Meeting type + RACI are **optional** frontmatter fields | Skills infer these from content/transcript; users can override. Enforcing them as required inputs would violate the Adaptive Executor pattern. CI validates schema shape and enum values (when present), not field population. |
| 10 | 2026-04-17 | Meeting type enum: `standup | planning | review | decision-making | brainstorm | 1-on-1 | stakeholder-review | project-kickoff | working-session | exec-briefing | other` | Merged F-17/F-18 taxonomies with design-doc variants. Final enum is shared across all 5 skills. |
| 11 | 2026-04-17 | RACI-4 enum: `decision-maker | contributor | informed | optional` | Simplified from full RACI; practical for meeting context. Used optionally across agenda, brief, recap, stakeholder-update. Synthesize skips per-attendee RACI (aggregates across meetings). |
| 12 | 2026-04-17 | Go-mode behavioral contract: infer → present brief summary → accept `go` or corrections | Default behavior. `--go` flag opts out of the checkpoint. Fully-specified invocations skip the checkpoint naturally. Blocking questions are permitted only when inference confidence is actively low on load-bearing inputs AND no reasonable default exists. |
| 13 | 2026-04-17 | Default meeting duration: **30 minutes** | Changed from 60. 30 min matches most internal-meeting norms; 60 min is aspirational. |
| 14 | 2026-04-17 | Anti-meeting check required in pre-meeting pair (agenda + brief) only | "Does this need to be a meeting?" as an opening prompt in `/meeting-agenda` and `/meeting-brief`. Not applicable to recap, synthesize, stakeholder-update (post-meeting). Not a frontmatter field; a flow step. |
| 15 | 2026-04-17 | Stakeholder-update audience: primary non-attendees, secondary some attendees | Framing reflects mixed-audience reality. Template says "readers who may or may not have been in the room" rather than "readers who weren't there." |
| 16 | 2026-04-17 | CI posture: enforcing from day one | All 5 skills authored together against the contract; no retroactive cleanup phase needed. Advisory-first only makes sense when cleaning up existing violations, which do not exist here. |
| 17 | 2026-04-17 | CI script: `scripts/validate-meeting-skills-family.sh` + `.ps1` + `.md` | Follows existing `.sh + .ps1 + .md` convention used by `check-count-consistency`, `validate-commands`, `lint-skills-frontmatter`. |
| 18 | 2026-04-17 | Skip per-skill `pm-skill-builder` runs | Design docs already cover classification, Why Gate, and structure that pm-skill-builder would generate. Redundant. If a validation pass is needed, run on the family-as-a-unit. |

**Count-update sweep**: most deferred items are count-consistency updates. The pattern in this repo is to sweep them together at release-commit time (run `scripts/check-count-consistency.sh`, update all locations that drifted). Not doing them one-by-one during authoring.

| 13 | Count-consistency sweep (critical path) | **completed 2026-04-17** — 15 files updated with current-state skill counts (32→38, 1→7 foundation, 39→45 commands). Historical release-note counts preserved intentionally. |
| 14 | Samples browse table + skills-manifest | **completed 2026-04-17** — README_SAMPLES.md (94→99, 5 new rows), skills-manifest.yaml (6 skill entries incl. F-26 + family contract note). Both validators PASS. |
| 15 | Add 5 more samples (1 additional per skill, bringing to 2-per-skill coverage) | **completed 2026-04-17** — agenda decision-meeting, brief negotiation-adjacent, recap stakeholder-review, synthesize exec-board-prep, stakeholder-update notion-mixed. 5 more samples (1 per skill, 3rd variant) remain deferred for full F-26 parity. |
| 16 | *[DEFERRED]* CHANGELOG + release notes + remaining count-drift files | Customary at tag time — QUICKSTART, docs/index.md, AGENTS/claude/CONTEXT.md, CHANGELOG entry, docs/releases/Release_v2.11.0.md |

Phases 1–10 are the scope of this scaffolding work. Phases 11–12 are downstream and deserve dedicated sessions.

## Open Items

Parked items that need attention but do not block execution.

1. **Sample count per skill** — F-26 shipped 3 thread samples. Is 3 the right number for meeting skills, or is 1 high-quality sample sufficient? Decide before phase 11.
2. **Krisp MCP reference in SKILL.md** — should each skill explicitly mention Krisp MCP as an input source, or keep it generic ("any transcript source")? Decide in phase 5 (spec).
3. **Workflow opportunity** — should a `meeting-lifecycle` workflow chain agenda → meeting → recap → stakeholder-update? Deferred per v2.11.0 plan open question 2. Not in this plan's scope.
4. **Public skill doc generation** — is there an auto-generation script (`scripts/generate-skill-pages.py` referenced in F-26)? Verify during phase 11; fall back to hand-authoring if not.
5. **CI workflow file choice** — add job to existing `validation.yml` or create new `validate-meeting-skills-family.yml`? Decide in phase 7 by reading current `validation.yml` structure.
6. **Versioning first shipment** — all 5 skills at `1.0.0` on first ship. Verify against `docs/internal/skill-versioning.md` governance doc during phase 4.
