Review the following tasks and create at least two (or more if you think best) documents for each (each with a table of contents). Organize the content as you see fit

Exploration Document: 

* Summary & deep-dive exploration of the problem, needs / pain points, desired outcomes, etc.
* Explore and expland on the idea. 
* What are the related best practices? 
* What are existing best-in-class implementations and repos to learn from and leverage?
* What are different approaches to solving this with the tradeoffs? What are your recommendations and why? What is the 80/20 value delivery?
* List questions for clarifications
* Achievable creative ideas & suggestions
* What are your assumptions?
* Help me understand feasibility
* Cautions or "gotchas"?
* What might I be missing?
* Evaluation of real value
* Next steps

Specification / Execution Document: Based on your 80/20 best-value approach, create a n agentic-development optimized detailed spec with execution plan. 

Specification Model Examples Document: Create a get-shit-done compatible and open-spec compatible specs

Additional Notes: 

- Explore anything inside E:\Projects\product-on-purpose\pm-skills that might be helpful
- Provide evidence traceability of internal and external sources used. 
- Research the web extensively as needed. 
- Do not bias heavily toward previous LLM outputs. 
- Do not modify any files outside of the E:\Projects\product-on-purpose\pm-skills directory tree

Export all docs to E:\Projects\product-on-purpose\pm-skills\docs\internal\_working

## 1. pm-skills + common files + multiple project structure

I want to figure out a way to setup, build out, and view multiple projects with pm-skills. 

https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done has an interesting model for "projects", but it is only one project per repo. 

The problem: Product Managers are always working on many projects at different phases of delivery. They need a way to easily group multiple iterations of documents together for projects. It would also be great to add transcripts to a folder for "processing" and have notes + suggested changes to related documents by processed, curated, and distributed. 

What should the architecture of this look like? 

Should this be a completely separate repo for other projects outside "pm-skills"? If so, what could that look like?

What is the critical path across all these needs? Where is the greatest real value?

## 2. Holistic pm-skill value

How could this pm-skill library be expanded to leverage more of claude code skill functionality (e.g. hooks, sub-agents, output styles)? What would that look like? How does it compare to the different scopes of functionality offered by claude code cli vs. vs code extension vs desktop ... vs codex ... vs gemini cli... vs cursor and others? What does the comparison / compatiblity matrix for this look like?

Could this be "standardized" into a pm delivery model? (e.g. get-shit-done, but specific for pm/ux?)

In addition to the requested documents create a 3rd that is more general (not specific to pm-skills) for my personal learning: General + deep dive into all of the "components" of the most effective and powerful skills. 

## 3. PM Skill Builder Skilll

Review the following: 

- E:\Projects\product-on-purpose\pm-skills\_NOTES\efforts\active\M-11-claude-plugin-packaging
- E:\Projects\product-on-purpose\pm-skills\_NOTES\efforts\active\skill_utility-skill-builder
- updated standards

I want to create a pm-skill-builder to expedite the process of creating pm-skills. Ideally I would be able to use web-based claude code and codex sections to execute the full deployment lifecycle of a skill. Is this feasible?

Currently there are 8 categories, 1 for each of the 6 phases of the triple-diamond model, foundations, and utility. 

This would also be great because it would allow a larger community to publish skills. 

What other CI or gh workflow automations need to be created to accomplish this?

- For maintaining pm-skills-mcp alignment automation?
- For appropriately accomodating different tools with different functionality (e.g. claude code, codex, etc)
- For handling tagged releases and update of readme + changelog + release notes + sample library (E:\Projects\product-on-purpose\pm-skills\library\skill-output-samples)

## 4. pm-skills roadmap

Based on all of the above... what are the most important skills that need to be created and/or existing skills that need to be iteratively improved?

Offer insight into value, need, frequency of use, complexity of problem, token/context usage, and other lenses you feel appropriate.

Separate this between: specific / contained individual skills and the pm-skills / pm-skills-mcp as a whole (since many of the topics covered here are bigger than an individual skill)
