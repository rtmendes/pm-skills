# Rename Plan: `_bundles` → `_workflows` + `/workflow-` Command Prefix

Status: Planning
Parent: [plan_v2.9.0.md](plan_v2.9.0.md)
Scope: pm-skills (primary) + pm-skills-mcp (downstream)

## Context

The term "bundle" is a packaging metaphor (webpack, npm). What the repo actually describes is a **process** . a guided, sequenced, multi-step workflow with handoffs and context flow. Every user-facing explanation in the repo already reaches for "workflow" to describe the concept. The pm-skills-mcp server already uses `pm_workflow_` as its tool name prefix.

This rename aligns terminology with:
- The repo's own documentation (which says "Workflow Bundles" everywhere)
- The broader agent/automation ecosystem (GitHub Actions, n8n, Zapier, Temporal . all use "workflow")
- The MCP server's existing public API (`pm_workflow_feature_kickoff`, etc.)

**Scope of change:** ~399 references across ~106 files in pm-skills, ~14 files in pm-skills-mcp.

## Decisions

| Decision | Answer | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Directory rename | `_bundles/` → `_workflows/` | Matches concept name |
| Docs directory | `docs/bundles/` → `docs/workflows/` | Follows source directory |
| Internal efforts dir | Already reorganized to `F-13-workflow-expansion/` | Done . draft files keep `bundle_` prefix as historical artifacts |
| Command prefix | `/workflow-{name}` | Namespace protection, signals multi-step process |
| `/kickoff` handling | Keep as alias, add `/workflow-feature-kickoff` | Backwards compatibility |
| MCP tool names | No change . already `pm_workflow_*` | Already correct |
| MCP type names | `WorkflowBundle` → `Workflow` | Drop "Bundle" from internal types |
| Nav section name | "Bundles" → "Workflows" | Matches concept |
| Timing | Part of v2.9.0 | Cheapest time . already touching every file for expansion |

## pm-skills-mcp Impact

**The MCP server is already 90% aligned.** The public tool names (`pm_workflow_*`), the listing tool (`pm_list_workflows`), and the source directory (`src/workflows/`) all use "workflow" already. The rename is almost entirely cosmetic in the MCP repo . just internal type names (`WorkflowBundle` → `Workflow`) and comments. No user-facing MCP API changes at all.

### Files to Update

| File | Refs | What Changes |
|------|------|-------------|
| `src/workflows/index.ts` | ~40 | `WorkflowBundle` interface → `Workflow`, `WORKFLOW_BUNDLES` → `WORKFLOWS`, `listWorkflowBundles()` → `listWorkflows()`, `getWorkflowBundle()` → `getWorkflow()` |
| `src/server.ts` | ~20 | Import renames, variable names (`bundles` → `workflows`), comment text |
| `src/config.ts` | 2 | Comment: "workflow bundle tools" → "workflow tools" |
| `tests/workflows.test.ts` | ~15 | `WORKFLOW_BUNDLES` → `WORKFLOWS`, function name updates |
| `tests/resources.test.ts` | 1 | Legacy URI test: `pm-skills://bundles/` → `pm-skills://workflows/` |
| `README.md` | ~10 | "Workflow Bundles" → "Workflows" in headings and descriptions |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | ~5 | v2.9.0 entry only; historical entries unchanged |
| `CLAUDE.md` | 1 | Tool count description |
| `AGENTS.md` | ~5 | Workflow table heading |
| `docs/architecture.md` | ~10 | "Workflow Bundles" → "Workflows" section |
| `docs/getting-started.md` | ~8 | "Workflow bundles" → "Workflows" |
| `docs/integration-guide.md` | ~5 | Bundle references in examples |
| `docs/releases/Release_v2.7.0.md` | 1 | Historical . leave as-is |
| `package.json` | 1 | Description text |

### What Does NOT Change in MCP

| Item | Current | Stays the Same |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Tool name prefix | `pm_workflow_` | Yes . already correct |
| Tool IDs | `feature-kickoff`, `lean-startup`, etc. | Yes . no "bundle" in IDs |
| Listing tool | `pm_list_workflows` | Yes . already correct |
| Module directory | `src/workflows/` | Yes . already correct |
| Resource URIs | `pm-skills://skills/*` | Yes . workflows aren't exposed as resources |

### MCP Coordination Timing

The MCP rename is **non-breaking** . no public tool names change. It can ship as:
- A patch release (`pm-skills-mcp v2.x.y`) for internal cleanup
- Bundled with the release that adds 6 new workflow tools

Recommend: ship MCP cleanup alongside the new workflow tool additions in a single pm-skills-mcp release after pm-skills v2.9.0.

## New CI to Add

### 1. Terminology Guard Script

**File:** `scripts/check-stale-bundle-refs.sh` + `.ps1`

**Purpose:** Post-rename migration guard that catches any remaining "bundle" references that should be "workflow". Runs in CI to prevent regression.

**Logic:**
```
1. Grep for /bundle/i across tracked files
2. Exclude known exceptions:
   - Historical release notes (docs/releases/Release_v2.0.md through v2.8.x)
   - Archived working docs (docs/internal/_working/distilled/_archived/)
   - Issue archives (.github/issues-archive/)
   - Sample library content (library/skill-output-samples/) . "bundle" may appear in product context
   - This plan file itself
   - Third-party files (node_modules, .git)
3. If any matches remain → WARN (advisory, not blocking)
4. Output list of files with stale references
```

**CI integration:** Add as advisory check in main `validate.yml` workflow, triggered by `docs/**` and `_workflows/**` changes.

### 2. Updated Path Triggers

**`validate-docs.yml`:**
```yaml
paths:
  - 'docs/**'
  - 'mkdocs.yml'
  - 'requirements-docs.txt'
  - 'skills/**/SKILL.md'
  - 'skills/**/TEMPLATE.md'
  - 'skills/**/EXAMPLE.md'
  - '_workflows/**'    # was: '_bundles/**'
```

**`deploy-docs.yml`:**
```yaml
paths:
  - 'docs/**'
  - 'mkdocs.yml'
  - '_workflows/**'    # was: '_bundles/**'
```

### 3. Updated AGENTS.md Sync Workflow

**`.github/workflows/sync-agents-md.yml`:**
- Hardcoded bundle table generation must be updated to reference `_workflows/` paths
- Section header: "Workflow Bundles" → "Workflows"
- Link targets: `_bundles/*.md` → `_workflows/*.md`

---

## Implementation Sequence

The rename must be sequenced carefully to avoid breaking CI at any intermediate commit.

### Option A: Single Atomic Commit (Recommended)

One commit that performs all renames and reference updates simultaneously. CI sees a consistent state.

**Pros:** No intermediate broken state, clean git history
**Cons:** Large diff, harder to review

### Option B: Two-Phase Commit

**Phase 1:** Directory renames + CI path updates + mkdocs nav (structural)
**Phase 2:** Content updates across all documentation files

**Pros:** Easier to review in two passes
**Cons:** Phase 1 alone may leave stale "bundle" text in docs (cosmetic, not broken)

### Recommended: Option A

Since this is a terminology rename (not a behavioral change), a single commit is cleaner. The diff is large but mechanical . find-and-replace with targeted exceptions.

## What NOT to Change

| Category | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Historical release notes (`docs/releases/Release_v2.0.md` through `v2.8.x`) | Document what was true at release time |
| Historical CHANGELOG entries (pre-v2.9.0) | Same . historical record |
| Archived working docs (`docs/internal/_working/distilled/_archived/`) | Dead documents, not worth the churn |
| Issue archive (`.github/issues-archive/`) | External snapshots |
| Sample library content (`library/skill-output-samples/`) | "bundle" in product context (e.g., JS bundle size), not workflow references |
| MCP tool names (`pm_workflow_*`) | Already correct . no user-facing change |
| MCP tool IDs (`feature-kickoff`, etc.) | Already correct |

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Broken internal links | High | `mkdocs build --strict` catches all broken doc links; AT-8 grep verification |
| Stale "bundle" references | Medium | Terminology guard script (AT-7) + AT-8 cross-link check |
| CI path triggers stale | High | AT-4 explicitly verifies new triggers fire |
| AGENTS.md sync workflow broken | Medium | AT-5 + manual check of sync-agents-md.yml output |
| MCP consumers break | Low | No public API names change . only internal type renames |
| External links to docs site break | **High** | **Hidden risk.** Anyone who bookmarked `product-on-purpose.github.io/pm-skills/bundles/feature-kickoff/` will get a 404 after rename. Mitigated by `mkdocs-redirects` plugin . see section below. |
| Release packaging misses `_workflows/` | Medium | AT-12 verifies build scripts updated |

### URL Redirect Plan (required)

This is a hidden risk that warrants proactive mitigation. The docs site is public and indexed . old `bundles/*` URLs will 404 after the rename unless redirects are in place.

**Solution: `mkdocs-redirects` plugin.** The repo already manages MkDocs plugins via `requirements-docs.txt`, so adding one more is trivial.

**Step 1 . Install:**
```
# Add to requirements-docs.txt
mkdocs-redirects
```

**Step 2 . Configure in `mkdocs.yml`:**
```yaml
plugins:
  - redirects:
      redirect_maps:
        'bundles/index.md': 'workflows/index.md'
        'bundles/feature-kickoff.md': 'workflows/feature-kickoff.md'
        'bundles/lean-startup.md': 'workflows/lean-startup.md'
        'bundles/triple-diamond.md': 'workflows/triple-diamond.md'
        # New workflows don't need redirects . they never had bundle URLs
```

**Step 3 . Verify:** Add acceptance test (see AT-13 below).

This handles:
- Direct bookmarks to bundle pages
- Search engine cached URLs
- External sites linking to the docs
- Zero maintenance . the plugin generates static redirect HTML files

### AT-13: URL Redirects

- [ ] `mkdocs-redirects` added to `requirements-docs.txt`
- [ ] Redirect map configured in `mkdocs.yml` for all 3 existing bundle URLs
- [ ] `mkdocs build --strict` still passes with redirects plugin
- [ ] Visiting `localhost:8000/bundles/feature-kickoff/` during `mkdocs serve` redirects to `workflows/feature-kickoff/`
- [ ] Visiting `localhost:8000/bundles/` redirects to `workflows/`
