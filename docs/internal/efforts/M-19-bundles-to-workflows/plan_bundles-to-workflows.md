# Rename Plan: `_bundles` → `_workflows` + `/workflow-` Command Prefix

Status: Planning (post-review)
Parent: [plan_v2.9.0.md](../../release-plans/v2.9.0/plan_v2.9.0.md)
Scope: pm-skills (primary) + pm-skills-mcp (downstream)
Reviewed by: Codex (GPT-5.4) . [review document](plan_bundles-to-workflows_reviewed-by-codex.md)

## Context

The term "bundle" is a packaging metaphor (webpack, npm). What the repo actually describes is a **process** . a guided, sequenced, multi-step workflow with handoffs and context flow. Every user-facing explanation in the repo already reaches for "workflow" to describe the concept. The pm-skills-mcp server already uses `pm_workflow_` as its tool name prefix.

This rename aligns terminology with:
- The repo's own documentation (which says "Workflow Bundles" everywhere)
- The broader agent/automation ecosystem (GitHub Actions, n8n, Zapier, Temporal . all use "workflow")
- The MCP server's existing public API (`pm_workflow_feature_kickoff`, etc.)

**Scope of change:** Approximately 400 references across ~100 files in pm-skills, ~14 files in pm-skills-mcp. Reference counts are approximate from a session-time grep (2026-04-06); re-verify from live tree before execution.

## Decisions

| Decision | Answer | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Directory rename | `_bundles/` → `_workflows/` | Matches concept name |
| Docs directory | `docs/bundles/` → `docs/workflows/` | Follows source directory |
| Internal efforts dir | Already reorganized to `F-13-workflow-expansion/` | Done . draft files keep `bundle_` prefix as historical artifacts |
| Command prefix | `/workflow-{name}` | Namespace protection, signals multi-step process |
| `/kickoff` handling | **Delete `commands/kickoff.md`**. Only `/workflow-feature-kickoff` exists. | Low adoption; avoids alias complexity and validator conflicts. Breaking change documented in release notes. |
| MCP tool names | No change . already `pm_workflow_*` | Already correct |
| MCP type renames | `WorkflowBundle` → `Workflow` etc. . **source-level API refactor**, not cosmetic | Exported TypeScript symbols change. No user-facing MCP tool-name break. |
| Nav section name | "Bundles" → "Workflows" | Matches concept |
| Timing | Part of v2.9.0 (Commit 1 per parent release plan) | Cheapest time . already touching every file for expansion |
| Terminology guard | Advisory (WARN) during transition; **promote to FAIL after v2.9.0 ships** | Prevents regression once exception list is stable |

## Impact Inventory

### A. Directory & File Renames (structural)

| Current Path | New Path | Type |
|-------------|----------|------|
| `_bundles/` | `_workflows/` | Directory rename |
| `_bundles/feature-kickoff.md` | `_workflows/feature-kickoff.md` | Moved with directory |
| `_bundles/lean-startup.md` | `_workflows/lean-startup.md` | Moved with directory |
| `_bundles/triple-diamond.md` | `_workflows/triple-diamond.md` | Moved with directory |
| `docs/bundles/` | `docs/workflows/` | Directory rename |
| `docs/bundles/index.md` | `docs/workflows/index.md` | Moved with directory |
| `docs/bundles/feature-kickoff.md` | `docs/workflows/feature-kickoff.md` | Moved with directory |
| `docs/bundles/lean-startup.md` | `docs/workflows/lean-startup.md` | Moved with directory |
| `docs/bundles/triple-diamond.md` | `docs/workflows/triple-diamond.md` | Moved with directory |
| ~~`docs/internal/efforts/bundles/`~~ | Reorganized to `F-13-workflow-expansion/` | Already done . see [F-13](../F-13-workflow-expansion.md) |
| `commands/kickoff.md` | `commands/workflow-feature-kickoff.md` | Rename (old file deleted, not aliased) |
| (new) | `_workflows/README.md` | Clarifies source-of-truth role, repo-relative links, do not edit `docs/workflows/` |
| (new) | `docs/workflows/README.md` | "Generated . do not edit directly. Run `scripts/generate-workflow-pages.py`." |

### B. Command File Changes (M-19 scope: rename only)

M-19 renames the existing command. The 6 new workflow commands are created in F-13.

| File | Command | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| `commands/workflow-feature-kickoff.md` | `/workflow-feature-kickoff` | Rename from `kickoff.md`, update internal `_bundles/` → `_workflows/` references |
| `commands/kickoff.md` | `/kickoff` | **Deleted** . breaking change, documented in release notes |

### C. Critical File Updates (pm-skills)

Files grouped by impact severity. Reference counts are approximate . re-verify before execution.

#### Tier 1 . Structural (breaks CI or packaging if missed)

## pm-skills-mcp Impact

**The MCP server is already 90% aligned.** The public tool names (`pm_workflow_*`), the listing tool (`pm_list_workflows`), and the source directory (`src/workflows/`) all use "workflow" already. The rename is a **source-level API refactor** inside the MCP repo . exported TypeScript symbols (`WorkflowBundle`, `WORKFLOW_BUNDLES`, `listWorkflowBundles()`, `getWorkflowBundle()`) change, but no user-facing MCP tool names or IDs change.

### Files to Update

| File | Refs | What Changes |
|------|------|-------------|
| `src/workflows/index.ts` | ~40 | `WorkflowBundle` interface → `Workflow`, `WORKFLOW_BUNDLES` → `WORKFLOWS`, `listWorkflowBundles()` → `listWorkflows()`, `getWorkflowBundle()` → `getWorkflow()` |
| `src/server.ts` | ~20 | Import renames, variable names (`bundles` → `workflows`), comment text |
| `src/config.ts` | 2 | Comment: "workflow bundle tools" → "workflow tools" |
| `tests/workflows.test.ts` | ~15 | `WORKFLOW_BUNDLES` → `WORKFLOWS`, function name updates |
| `README.md` | ~10 | "Workflow Bundles" → "Workflows" in headings and descriptions |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | ~5 | v2.9.0 entry only; historical entries unchanged |
| `CLAUDE.md` | 1 | Tool count description |
| `AGENTS.md` | ~5 | Workflow table heading |
| `docs/architecture.md` | ~10 | "Workflow Bundles" → "Workflows" section |
| `docs/getting-started.md` | ~8 | "Workflow bundles" → "Workflows" |
| `docs/integration-guide.md` | ~5 | Bundle references in examples |
| `package.json` | 1 | Description text |

### What Does NOT Change in MCP

| Item | Current | Stays the Same |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Tool name prefix | `pm_workflow_` | Yes . already correct |
| Tool IDs | `feature-kickoff`, `lean-startup`, etc. | Yes . no "bundle" in IDs |
| Listing tool | `pm_list_workflows` | Yes . already correct |
| Module directory | `src/workflows/` | Yes . already correct |
| Resource URIs | `pm-skills://skills/*` | Yes . workflows aren't exposed as resources |
| `tests/resources.test.ts` | Asserts `pm-skills://bundles/feature-kickoff` returns null | Yes . keep existing rejection test as-is |

### MCP Coordination Timing

The MCP rename is **non-breaking** for tool consumers . no public tool names change. It can ship as:
- A patch release (`pm-skills-mcp v2.x.y`) for the source refactor
- Bundled with the release that adds 6 new workflow tools

Recommend: ship MCP cleanup alongside the new workflow tool additions in a single pm-skills-mcp release after pm-skills v2.9.0.

---

## New CI to Add

### 1. Terminology Guard Script

**File:** `scripts/check-stale-bundle-refs.sh` + `.ps1`

**Purpose:** Post-rename migration guard that catches any remaining "bundle" references that should be "workflow". Runs in CI to prevent regression.

**Logic:**
```
1. Grep for /bundle/i across tracked files
2. Exclude known exceptions:
   - Historical release notes (docs/releases/Release_v2.0.md through v2.8.x)
   - Archived working docs (docs/internal/_working/distilled/_archived/)
   - Issue archives (.github/issues-archive/)
   - Sample library content (library/skill-output-samples/) . "bundle" may appear in product context
   - F-13 draft files (docs/internal/efforts/F-13-workflow-expansion/bundle_*)
   - scripts/README_SCRIPTS.md ("release bundle" is generic usage)
   - Third-party files (node_modules, .git)
3. If any matches remain → WARN (advisory during v2.9.0 transition)
4. Output list of files with stale references
5. Post-v2.9.0: promote to FAIL to prevent regression
```

**CI integration:** Add as advisory check in `.github/workflows/validation.yml`, triggered by `docs/**` and `_workflows/**` changes.

### 2. Updated Path Triggers

**`validate-docs.yml`:**
```yaml
paths:
  - 'docs/**'
  - 'mkdocs.yml'
  - 'requirements-docs.txt'
  - 'skills/**/SKILL.md'
  - 'skills/**/TEMPLATE.md'
  - 'skills/**/EXAMPLE.md'
  - '_workflows/**'    # was: '_bundles/**'
```

**`deploy-docs.yml`:**
```yaml
paths:
  - 'docs/**'
  - 'mkdocs.yml'
  - '_workflows/**'    # was: '_bundles/**'
```

### 3. Updated AGENTS.md Sync Workflow

**`.github/workflows/sync-agents-md.yml`:**
- Path trigger: `_bundles/*.md` → `_workflows/*.md`
- Hardcoded workflow table: update section header "Workflow Bundles" → "Workflows", column header "Bundle" → "Workflow"
- Link targets: `_bundles/*.md` → `_workflows/*.md`
- All 3 existing workflow entries updated; 6 new entries added in F-13

---

## Implementation Sequence

M-19 ships as **Commit 1** in the v2.9.0 release (per the parent release plan's two-commit strategy). The "single atomic commit" recommendation means all M-19 rename work lands in one commit . not that all of v2.9.0 is one commit.

### Single Atomic Commit for M-19

One commit that performs all directory renames, file renames, reference updates, CI changes, and redirect setup simultaneously. CI sees a consistent state.

**Pros:** No intermediate broken state, clean git history
**Cons:** Large diff, harder to review

This is appropriate because the rename is mechanical . find-and-replace with targeted exceptions per the "What NOT to Change" section.

## What NOT to Change

| Category | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Historical release notes (`docs/releases/Release_v2.0.md` through `v2.8.x`) | Document what was true at release time |
| Historical CHANGELOG entries (pre-v2.9.0) | Same . historical record |
| Archived working docs (`docs/internal/_working/distilled/_archived/`) | Dead documents, not worth the churn |
| Issue archive (`.github/issues-archive/`) | External snapshots |
| Sample library content (`library/skill-output-samples/`) | "bundle" in product context (e.g., JS bundle size), not workflow references |
| `scripts/README_SCRIPTS.md` | "release bundle" is generic usage, not a workflow reference |
| F-13 draft files (`docs/internal/efforts/F-13-workflow-expansion/bundle_*`) | Historical drafts . keep original terminology |
| MCP tool names (`pm_workflow_*`) | Already correct . no user-facing change |
| MCP tool IDs (`feature-kickoff`, etc.) | Already correct |
| MCP resource test (`tests/resources.test.ts`) | Tests URI rejection, not support . keep as-is |

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Broken internal links | High | `mkdocs build --strict` catches all broken doc links; AT-8 grep verification |
| Stale "bundle" references | Medium | Terminology guard script (AT-7) + AT-8 cross-link check; promote to FAIL post-v2.9.0 |
| CI path triggers stale | High | AT-4 explicitly verifies new triggers fire |
| AGENTS.md sync workflow broken | Medium | AT-5 + manual check of sync-agents-md.yml output |
| MCP source API break | Low | No user-facing tool names change; TypeScript export renames are internal to pm-skills-mcp |
| Docs site URL breakage | **High** | `mkdocs-redirects` plugin . see URL Redirect Plan below |
| Repo-path breakage (external consumers) | Medium | Breaking-change callout in v2.9.0 release notes. Low adoption mitigates impact. |
| Release packaging misses `_workflows/` | Medium | AT-9 verifies build scripts updated |
| `/kickoff` removal | Low | Documented in release notes. Low adoption. |

### URL Redirect Plan (required)

The docs site is public and indexed . old `bundles/*` URLs will 404 after the rename unless redirects are in place.

**Solution: `mkdocs-redirects` plugin.** The repo already manages MkDocs plugins via `requirements-docs.txt`, so adding one more is trivial.

**Step 1 . Install:**
```
# Add to requirements-docs.txt
mkdocs-redirects
```

**Step 2 . Configure in `mkdocs.yml`:**
```yaml
plugins:
  - redirects:
      redirect_maps:
        'bundles/index.md': 'workflows/index.md'
        'bundles/feature-kickoff.md': 'workflows/feature-kickoff.md'
        'bundles/lean-startup.md': 'workflows/lean-startup.md'
        'bundles/triple-diamond.md': 'workflows/triple-diamond.md'
        # New workflows don't need redirects . they never had bundle URLs
```

**Step 3 . Verify:** AT-11.

This handles:
- Direct bookmarks to bundle pages
- Search engine cached URLs
- External sites linking to the docs
- Zero maintenance . the plugin generates static redirect HTML files

**Note:** URL redirects only cover the docs site. GitHub repo-path links to `_bundles/` will break. This is documented as a breaking change in the v2.9.0 release notes.
