## Review Checklist

### M-12 Review
- [x] `validate-agents-md.sh` correctly detects missing and orphan AGENTS.md entries — verified: detects missing, orphan, and duplicate entries
- [x] `validate-agents-md.ps1` is a faithful Windows equivalent — verified: functional parity confirmed (Group-Object vs sort|uniq-d, same logic)
- [x] `check-mcp-impact.sh` correctly identifies skill additions/renames and is non-blocking — verified: A status + R[0-9]+ status detected, always exits 0
- [x] `check-mcp-impact.ps1` is a faithful Windows equivalent — verified: same detection logic, same advisory messaging
- [x] Enhanced `lint-skills-frontmatter.sh` checks description word count (20-100) — verified: awk NF counting, all 26 skills pass (range: 23-37 words)
- [x] Enhanced linter checks TEMPLATE.md header count (≥3 ##) — verified: grep -c '^## ', all 26 skills pass (range: 5-7 headers)
- [x] `validation.yml` runs new scripts on both ubuntu and windows — verified: **fixed duplicate steps** (validate-agents-md ran twice, check-mcp-impact ran twice)
- [x] All 26 existing skills pass the enhanced validators — verified: 26/26 pass all checks
- [ ] Workflow runs in < 60 seconds — not tested (requires CI run)
- [x] Script documentation (.md files) follows existing convention — verified: usage, examples, exit codes documented
- [x] `.sh + .ps1 + .md` convention followed for all new scripts — verified: validate-agents-md and check-mcp-impact both have all 3 files

### F-06 Review
- [x] SKILL.md frontmatter is valid (name matches dir, phase=deliver, all required fields) — verified: 38-word description, all fields present
- [x] SKILL.md content follows established patterns (numbered instructions, output contract, quality checklist) — verified: 7 numbered steps, Output Contract, 7-item Quality Checklist
- [x] TEMPLATE.md has ≥3 ## sections with guidance comments — verified: 6 sections with HTML guidance comments
- [x] EXAMPLE.md is a complete artifact (not an outline), realistic scenario — verified: guest checkout e-commerce scenario, all sections populated, 85 content lines
- [x] Command file references correct skill path — verified: matches `skills/deliver-acceptance-criteria/SKILL.md`
- [x] AGENTS.md entry uses correct path format — verified: `#### acceptance-criteria` + `**Path:**` + description + `---`
- [x] Skill content is genuinely useful for PMs (not just structurally correct) — verified: Given/When/Then format, covers happy path + edge cases + error states + NFRs

### Cross-Effort Consistency
- [x] F-06 passes M-12's enhanced validation (linter + agents-md + mcp-impact) — verified: 38 words (20-100 ✓), 6 headers (≥3 ✓), AGENTS.md synced
- [x] F-06 follows the same patterns as existing Deliver phase skills — verified: compared against deliver-user-stories and deliver-edge-cases
- [x] No unintended changes to other files — verified: only expected files modified/created

## Codex's Notes

Codex reported:
- Both efforts run locally on bash and PowerShell successfully
- Recommended merge order: M-12 first, then F-06 (so new skill is gated by enhanced CI)
- Or: merge as one combined PR
- Pre-existing unrelated local changes were left untouched

## Review Output

**Review completed 2026-03-22 by Claude Opus 4.6**

### M-12 Verdict: PASS (with one fix applied)

**Blocking issue found and fixed:**
- `validation.yml` had duplicate steps: `validate-agents-md` appeared twice (lines 30-36 and 46-52), `check-mcp-impact` appeared twice (lines 54-62 and 74-82). This was a copy-paste error. Fixed by removing the duplicate blocks.

**Non-blocking observation:**
- Output format inconsistency: bash scripts use Unicode `✓`/`✗`, PowerShell uses `[OK]`/`[FAIL]`. Documentation examples show `[OK]`/`[FAIL]` style. Not blocking — can be standardized in a future M-13 convention pass.

**All scripts are functionally correct.** Logic verified, cross-platform parity confirmed, all 26 skills pass.

### F-06 Verdict: PASS (no changes needed)

Production-ready. Clean convention compliance, high-quality content, realistic example. The guest checkout scenario is particularly well-chosen — it demonstrates all four criteria categories (happy path, edge cases, error states, non-functional) with concrete, recognizable examples.

### Recommendation

Merge as a single commit. Both efforts are clean and F-06 was designed to pass M-12's enhanced validation. The workflow fix (removing duplicates) is a minor correction that doesn't affect Codex's original implementation logic.
