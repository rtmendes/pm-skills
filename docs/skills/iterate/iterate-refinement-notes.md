# Refinement Notes

!!! info "Quick facts"
    **Phase:** Iterate | **Version:** 2.0.0 | **Category:** coordination | **License:** Apache-2.0

**Try it:** `/refinement-notes "Your context here"`
{ .md-button }

Refinement notes capture the outcomes of backlog refinement (grooming) sessions.what was discussed, what was estimated, and what decisions were made. They serve as a quick reference for team members who missed the session and a historical record of how stories evolved from idea to ready-for-sprint.

## When to Use

- During refinement sessions to capture decisions in real-time
- After refinement to share outcomes with absent team members
- When onboarding new team members to explain backlog context
- Before sprint planning to review what's been refined
- When stories need re-refinement due to time elapsed

## How to Use

Use the `/refinement-notes` slash command:

```
/refinement-notes "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/iterate-refinement-notes/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to document refinement notes, follow these steps:

1. **Record Session Metadata**
   Note the date, attendees, and duration. This helps track who was part of decisions and when discussions happened.

2. **List Stories Discussed**
   For each story, capture the outcome: estimated points, refined status, key discussion points, and any modifications made to the original scope.

3. **Document Questions Raised**
   Questions that couldn't be answered in the session need owners and due dates. Don't let them disappear.they often block sprint planning.

4. **Capture Decisions Made**
   Record any scope decisions, technical approaches agreed upon, or priority changes. These decisions are valuable context that gets lost without documentation.

5. **Note Action Items**
   Any follow-up work needed before stories are sprint-ready: mockups to create, technical spikes to run, stakeholders to consult.

6. **Flag Blocked Stories**
   Clearly identify stories that can't proceed until blockers are resolved. Include what the blocker is and who owns resolution.

7. **Plan Next Session**
   Note what should be refined next and any preparation needed.

    ## Questions Raised

    | Question | Raised By | Owner | Due Date | Status |
    |----------|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
    | Should CSV export include hidden columns? | Jordan | Taylor | Jan 15 | Open |
    | What's the plan for internationalization of exported dates? | Sam | Taylor | Jan 15 | Open |
    | Can we get design specs for dark mode by Thursday? | Maya | Design Lead | Jan 16 | Open |

    ### Question Details

    **Q: Should CSV export include hidden columns?**
    - Context: Users can hide columns in the report view. Should hidden columns appear in export?
    - Impact: Minor.doesn't block story, but affects implementation detail
    - Notes: Taylor leaning toward "export matches what you see" but will confirm with customers

    **Q: What's the plan for internationalization of exported dates?**
    - Context: We have users in multiple locales. Dates in CSV might be ambiguous.
    - Impact: Could affect USER-342 scope
    - Notes: Options: ISO 8601 dates (unambiguous) or locale-specific with locale in filename

    ---

    ## Decisions Made

    | Decision | Context | Made By |
    |----------|---------|---------|
    | Use ISO 8601 dates for CSV exports | Locale-specific dates too confusing; ISO is unambiguous | Team consensus |
    | Split USER-348 into 3 stories | Original story too large (13+ points) | Team consensus |
    | Add performance test to USER-347 | Prevent regression after optimization | Jordan's suggestion, team agreed |

    ---

    ## Action Items

    | Action | Owner | Due Date | Status |
    |--------|-------|----------|--------|
    | Create split stories for USER-348 | Taylor | Jan 15 | Not Started |
    | Answer CSV hidden columns question | Taylor | Jan 15 | Not Started |
    | Follow up with design on dark mode specs | Maya | Jan 16 | Not Started |
    | Update USER-342 with ISO 8601 date decision | Jordan | Jan 14 | Not Started |

    ---

    ## Blocked Stories

    | Story | Blocker | Owner | Expected Resolution |
    |-------|---------|-------|---------------------|
    | USER-350 | Missing dark mode design specs | Design Lead | Jan 16 (Maya to follow up) |

    ---

    ## Parking Lot

    - **Mobile responsive settings:** Jordan raised that settings page isn't mobile-friendly. Agreed to create a separate story rather than expand USER-348 scope. Taylor to add to backlog.
    - **Export to Google Sheets:** Customer request came in during session. Taylor will assess priority and create story if warranted.

    ---

    ## Next Session

    **Date:** January 21, 2026, 2:00 PM EST
    **Stories to Prepare:**
    - USER-348a, 348b, 348c: Split settings stories (after Taylor creates them)
    - USER-350: Dark mode (if design specs received)
    - USER-352: Bulk user invite (Taylor to write story by Thursday)

    **Preparation Needed:**
    - Taylor: Create split stories for USER-348 by Thursday
    - Maya: Confirm design specs timeline for dark mode
    - Chris: Review notes and raise any concerns async (returning from PTO)

## Real-World Examples

See this skill applied to three different product contexts:

??? example "Storevine (B2B): Storevine B2B ecommerce platform . Campaigns v1.1 sprint refinement session"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /refinement-notes

    Session: Campaigns v1.1 refinement
    Date: July 22, 2026, 10:00 AM, 60 minutes
    Sprint preparing for: Sprint 12 . Campaigns v1.1
    Facilitator: Growth PM

    Stories on the agenda:
    1. CAM-088: EU merchant GDPR consent data model
    2. CAM-089: Per-campaign open rate and click rate analytics
    3. CAM-090: Follow-on experiment . 3 vs. 5 products in guided template
    4. CAM-091: Abandoned cart email trigger

    Key constraints:
    - Legal has not yet signed off on the EU consent model (CAM-088)
    - Backend Engineer flagged ambiguity on the open rate denominator
      (CAM-089): Amplitude delivered-event count vs. SendGrid recipient count
    - CAM-091 may need to be split . scope spans 4 engineering domains

    Need: full refinement notes for Sprint 12 planning.

    # Refinement Notes: July 22, 2026

??? example "Brainshelf (Consumer): Brainshelf consumer PKM app . Sprint 9 refinement for Resurface v2 improvements"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /refinement-notes

    sprint 9 refinement for resurface v2. session was april 15, 2026.
    45 minutes. priya facilitated.

    stories discussed:
    1. RSF-010: embedding migration (tfidf → openai text-embedding-3-small)
       . BLOCKED, waiting on openai api key + budget approval from marco
    2. RSF-011: in-app resurfacing card on home screen . Ready, 5 pts [fictional]
    3. RSF-012: cadence experiment (daily vs 3x/week, larger sample) .
       Ready, 3 pts [fictional]
    4. RSF-013: small-library handling (users with <20 items, shorter
       exclusion window) . Needs Work, alex wants to see the data first

    questions raised: should the in-app card show different items than
    the email digest or the same items? what's the minimum library size
    where tfidf actually produces useful results?

    decision: in-app card shows different items (complementary, not
    duplicate).
    ```

    **Output:**

    # Refinement Notes: April 15, 2026

??? example "Workbench (Enterprise): Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: Blueprints v1.1 backlog refinement session"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /refinement-notes

    I just ran the v1.1 refinement session. Here are the details:

    **Session info:**
    - Date: May 26, 2026
    - Duration: 60 minutes
    - Attendees: Rachel V. (PM, facilitator), Karen L. (Eng Lead), Tomás G. (Design), Nate P. (Backend), Aisha K. (Frontend), Leo M. (Data)

    **Stories refined (6):**

    1. BLUE-201: Approval action bar redesign -- promote Reject and Request Changes to primary visibility
       - Points: 3 (was 2 from retro; increased after discussion of animation transitions)
       - Ready for sprint

    2. BLUE-202: Audit trail export (CSV) -- compliance officer can export all Blueprint lifecycle events for a date range
       - Points: 8
       - Ready for sprint
       - Note: Nate P. flagged that the current audit log stores events in an append-only format optimized for writes, not reads. The export query will need a read-optimized view or materialized table.

    3. BLUE-203: Audit trail export (PDF) -- formatted PDF export for regulatory submissions
       - Points: 5
       - Blocked -- depends on BLUE-202 (CSV export provides the data layer); also needs legal review of the PDF format for FDA/SOX compliance

    4. BLUE-204: Configurable wizard threshold -- template admins can set the section count at which the wizard auto-disables (default: 12)
       - Points: 2
       - Ready for sprint

    5. BLUE-205: Approver-visible completeness score -- display per-section quality indicators in the approval review view
       - Points: 8
       - Ready for sprint (design review scheduled for May 28)
       - Note: Tomás G. proposed a progress bar showing "% sections with 20+ words" plus yellow warning badges on sections below threshold. Karen L. asked whether the threshold should be configurable -- team decided to hardcode 20 words for v1.1 and make it configurable in v1.2 if needed.

    6. BLUE-206: Compliance officer role -- new RBAC role with template-lock and audit-export permissions
       - Points: 13
       - Blocked -- depends on BLUE-202 (audit export) for the export permission; also needs Karen L. to design the RBAC extension architecture

    **Questions raised:**
    - Should the audit trail export include section-level edit history or just lifecycle events? (Decision: lifecycle events only for v1.1; section-level history deferred to version history feature)
    - Should the completeness score be visible to authors during editing, or only to approvers? (Decision: approvers only for now; author-visible is a future consideration)
    - What happens to in-flight Blueprints when a compliance officer locks a template? (Parked for BLUE-206 design)

    **Decisions made:**
    - Wizard threshold default stays at 12 (consistency with v1) but is now admin-configurable
    - Completeness word-count threshold is hardcoded at 20 words for v1.1
    - Audit trail export scope is lifecycle events only (not section edit history)

    Please generate the full refinement notes.
