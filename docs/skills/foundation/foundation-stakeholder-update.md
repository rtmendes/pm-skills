description: "Produces async communication to stakeholders, primarily non-attendees and secondarily some attendees who want a reference. Translates meeting outcomes into what-it-means language for readers, with channel variants (slack, teams, email, notion, exec-memo) and audience variants (engineering, design, leadership, customer-facing, mixed). Surfaces a primary CTA up front, flags technical-to-business translations for user verification, and detects thread continuation from prior updates."

# Stakeholder Update

!!! info "Quick facts"
    **Classification:** Foundation | **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Category:** meeting | **License:** Apache-2.0

**Try it:** `/stakeholder-update "Your context here"`
{ .md-button }

A stakeholder update is async communication to readers who need to know the outcomes of a meeting. Primary audience is non-attendees; secondary audience is some attendees who want a reference version (came in late, stepped out, need something to forward).

Distinct from `/meeting-recap` in audience, format, and purpose: the recap is a summary of what happened for people who were in the room; the stakeholder-update is a translation of outcomes into what-it-means for readers (tailored to their role, with technical-to-business translation where the audience warrants it).

Distinct from `/discover-stakeholder-summary`: that skill is about understanding stakeholders (input to the user's work). This skill is about communicating to stakeholders (output from the user's work).

This skill belongs to the Meeting Skills Family. It conforms to the [Meeting Skills Family Contract](../../docs/reference/skill-families/meeting-skills-contract.md).

## When to Use

- After a meeting with outcomes affecting teams who were not in the room
- When a decision or commitment needs to propagate to downstream teams async
- When a recap exists and needs to be translated into audience-specific language
- When the user needs something from readers (specific CTA) and cannot afford for it to be buried

## When NOT to Use

- Summarizing what happened for attendees. Use `/meeting-recap`.
- Broadcasting status with no specific audience tailoring. A plain Slack message is sufficient; the skill adds value when translation or CTA framing matters.
- Communicating research findings to stakeholders. Use `/discover-interview-synthesis` plus targeted comms.

## How to Use

Use the `/stakeholder-update` slash command:

```
/stakeholder-update "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/foundation-stakeholder-update/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to create a stakeholder update, follow these steps:

1. **Load related recap**
   Parse frontmatter to extract meeting context, decisions, actions, outcomes. If no recap provided, accept raw meeting notes with a lower input-quality flag.

2. **Detect thread continuation**
   Scan same directory for prior `stakeholder-update` artifacts with matching `project` / `topics`. If found, reference the prior update in the frontmatter `thread_continuation_of` field.

3. **Present go-mode inference summary**
   Show inferred channel (if not specified), detected audience, proposed CTA, thread continuation status, translation candidates (flagged jargon or acronyms that may not land).

4. **Distill key outcomes**
   From the recap or notes, select 3-5 outcomes that matter to the target audience. Do not include everything from the recap. filter by audience relevance.

5. **Frame the CTA**
   If action is needed: lead with it, not bury it
   If FYI-only: state explicitly in the TL;DR

6. **Translate technical-to-business**
   Flag jargon and acronyms unlikely to land with the audience. Provide plainer alternatives. Keep a translations-applied log for user verification in the output's Generation context.

7. **Build the channel-tailored variant**

   - **Slack / Teams**: headline (one action-oriented line, optionally one emoji), TL;DR 3 bullets, context sentence, "what this means for [audience]", CTA (bold with marker if action needed; italic "FYI-only" if not), thread-continuation link, more-links footer
   - **Email**: subject line (topic + outcome), greeting ("Hi [audience]"), opening sentence (headline + why they are receiving this), TL;DR, context 2-3 sentences, what was decided / advanced, what this means for your team, what I need from you (with by-when), thread reference, sign-off
   - **Notion**: rich H1/H2/H3 structure, longer context block, collapsible sections for detail, table for decisions and actions
   - **Exec-memo**: TL;DR first (3-4 lines), supporting detail in 3 sections max, asks section upfront, formal tone, no emoji

8. **Render TEMPLATE.md with the selected variant as primary**
   Other variants may be included as collapsible alternates for user flexibility. Remove all guidance blockquotes from the final artifact.

9. **Validate**
   - `channel` is in enum
   - `audience_variant` is in enum
   - `primary_cta` is non-empty (use "FYI-only" if no action needed)
   - `related_recap` is a valid filename reference or flagged as raw-notes input

## Technical-to-business translation notes

> [guidance: include this section when translations were applied, so the user can verify translations land with their audience]

**Translations applied**:

- "{{Technical term}}" → "{{Plain language}}" *(reason: audience = {{variant}})*
- "{{Acronym}}" → "{{Expanded meaning}}"

**Flagged but kept** (may need further review):

- "{{Term}}". may not land with all readers, consider rewording if update goes wider

    ### Slack / Teams variant (primary. matches frontmatter channel)

    **Search feature Q2: scope and capacity decided; ship-date pending vendor review**

    **TL;DR**

    - MVP scope: autocomplete + filters IN, saved searches OUT (deferred to v2)
    - Q2 engineering capacity: 8 sprint-weeks committed
    - Ship-date deferred 1 week pending Algolia licensing review

    **Context**

    Kickoff yesterday settled the scope and capacity questions that have been open since January. Ship-date commitment was paused when alex surfaced an Algolia licensing question that needs resolution before we lock a date.

    **What this means for engineering**

    The scope agreed is narrower than the original proposal, which means no backfill is needed to absorb search work into Q2. If your team has dependencies on design-system components we use for search (autocomplete patterns, filter chips), those should not shift. The main watch-out: if Algolia licensing turns out to be restrictive, we may need to evaluate self-hosting or a different provider, which would touch infra planning.

    **What I need from you**

    - Confirm no dependency conflicts with your Q2 plans by 2026-04-22
    - If you see infra implications from a potential provider change, flag in thread before Monday

    ### Email variant (alternate)

    **Subject**: Search feature Q2 scope and capacity decided; ship-date pending vendor review

    Hi engineering leads,

    Sending this because yesterday's search-feature kickoff produced scope and capacity decisions that may touch your Q2 planning. Wanted to get this in front of you ahead of Monday sprint planning.

    **TL;DR**

    - MVP scope: autocomplete + filters IN; saved searches OUT (deferred to v2)
    - Q2 engineering capacity: 8 sprint-weeks committed
    - Ship-date deferred 1 week pending Algolia licensing review

    **Context**

    Scope and capacity have been open questions since January. Kickoff yesterday converged both: we narrowed scope relative to the original proposal, which made the capacity commitment (8 sprint-weeks) workable without backfill. The vendor-licensing question emerged in the same meeting and is the one outstanding item.

    **What was decided or advanced**

    - Scope narrowed: saved-searches deferred to v2; autocomplete and filters held
    - 8 sprint-weeks committed for Q2 search work
    - Monthly review cadence agreed with CFO for Q2 progress tracking

    **What this means for your team**

    The narrowed scope means no capacity conflicts for other Q2 commitments. If Algolia licensing turns out to be restrictive, we may need a provider-change evaluation, which would touch infra planning. That is the main watch-out; current estimate is we know by 2026-04-22.

    **What I need from you**

    - Confirm no dependency conflicts with your Q2 plans by 2026-04-22
    - If you see infra implications from a potential provider change, flag before Monday sprint planning

    For more detail, see the [meeting recap](2026-04-17_14-00EST_search-feature-kickoff_recap.md).

    Thanks,

    ### Notion / exec-memo variants

    > [For notion and exec-memo variants, see the reference template. Primary output for this example is the slack variant above.]

    ---

    ## Technical-to-business translation notes

    **Translations applied**:

    - "autocomplete" kept as-is (engineering audience knows the term)
    - "8 sprint-weeks" kept as-is (engineering audience tracks by sprint-week)
    - "backfill" kept as-is (engineering-native term)

    **Flagged but kept** (may need further review for non-engineering audiences):

    - "Algolia licensing". if update goes to non-engineering readers, add context on what Algolia is (search provider) and why licensing matters
    - "provider-change evaluation". if wider audience, rephrase as "evaluate different search tooling"
