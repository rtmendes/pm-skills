title: "foundation-meeting-agenda"
description: "Produces an attendee-facing agenda that sets what will be discussed, who owns each topic, and how time will be spent. Supports ten meeting type variants (standup, planning, review, decision-making, brainstorm, 1-on-1, stakeholder-review, project-kickoff, working-session, exec-briefing). Emits a shareable summary suitable for Slack or email plus a full agenda with time-boxed topics, type tags, owners, attendee prep, and logistics."

# Meeting Agenda

!!! info "Quick facts"
    **Classification:** Foundation | **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Category:** meeting | **License:** Apache-2.0

**Try it:** `/meeting-agenda "Your context here"`
{ .md-button }

A meeting agenda is the attendee-facing structural document that sets expectations before a meeting. It answers "what will we discuss, who owns each topic, how will we spend the time, and what does done look like?" Distinct from a meeting brief, which is the user's private strategic prep; the agenda is shared with participants and focused on structure and flow.

This skill belongs to the Meeting Skills Family. It conforms to the [Meeting Skills Family Contract](../../docs/reference/skill-families/meeting-skills-contract.md), which defines shared frontmatter, file naming, the go-mode behavioral pattern, and universal output requirements across all meeting skills.

## When to Use

- Running or chairing a cross-functional working session, project kickoff, stakeholder review, or decision meeting
- Any meeting with more than three attendees or more than thirty minutes
- Recurring meeting where a rolling structure (1-on-1, team sync) needs fresh framing each time
- Mid-initiative alignment moment where explicit desired outcomes prevent drift

## When NOT to Use

- The user's preparation is private and tactical (positioning, stakeholder reads, asks). Use `/meeting-brief` instead.
- The meeting has already happened. Use `/meeting-recap` for post-meeting summarization.
- The user wants to communicate outcomes to non-attendees. Use `/stakeholder-update` after the meeting.

## How to Use

Use the `/meeting-agenda` slash command:

```
/meeting-agenda "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/foundation-meeting-agenda/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to create a meeting agenda, follow these steps:

1. **Run anti-meeting check**
   Apply the trigger patterns above. If the user's objective matches, propose the async alternative and ask for override. Only proceed to step 2 on explicit override.

2. **Parse and load inputs**
   Read the topic or purpose. Load all `@file` references provided. Extract any attendee list, time constraints, or linked documents.

3. **Infer missing values**
   Apply these inference rules:

   | Value | Inferred from | Default |
   |-------|---------------|---------|
   | Meeting type | Topic keywords, attendee seniority mix | `other` (low confidence) |
   | Duration | Explicit in topic doc (rare); meeting-type-specific default when type is inferred at medium+ confidence | v1.1.0: type-specific (see family contract). 30 min only for `other`, `1-on-1`, `exec-briefing`, `customer-call`. Kickoff = 60, working-session = 60, decision-making = 45, etc. |
   | Objective | Topic phrasing | Infer; surface in summary |
   | Attendee RACI | Seniority, topic ownership cues | Flag all inferences |
   | Desired outcomes | Objective plus meeting type heuristics | Offer strawman |

   **Load-bearing inference gates** (v1.1.0): when attendee RACI or desired outcomes are inferred below-high confidence, flag in the go-mode summary with `⚠`. See family contract "Zero-friction execution" section.

4. **Present go-mode inference summary**
   Show the inferred values with confidence markers. Accept `go` to proceed, or corrections to revise. Re-run inference after any correction and present the summary again.

5. **Design the time-boxed topic list**
   Apply the meeting-type variant (see below). Size topic times so their sum equals the meeting duration. If the topic list overflows the available time, flag it explicitly and ask for reconciliation (do not silently trim).

   Each topic must have:
   - Type tag: `Discussion | Decision | Information | Working`
   - Owner (name or team)
   - Goal (what done looks like)
   - Time allocation
   - Pre-read link if any

6. **Specify attendee prep**
   List required prep with links and estimated prep time. Add recommended context for attendees who want deeper background. Add "come ready to" expectations that force clarity on what each attendee contributes.

7. **Add parking lot and logistics placeholders**
   Parking lot is a placeholder for off-topic items raised during the meeting. Logistics covers join link, materials needed, recording ownership.

8. **Render the TEMPLATE.md with filled values**
   Remove all guidance blockquotes from the final artifact.

9. **Validate output**
   - Frontmatter shape conforms to the family contract's universal base fields plus agenda-specific fields (`meeting_duration_minutes`, `desired_outcomes`)
   - Sum of topic times equals meeting duration (+/- 2 min tolerance)
   - At least one desired outcome is listed
   - Anti-meeting check result is recorded in `Generation context`

    ### Purpose

    Commit to an in/out MVP scope, confirm engineering capacity for Q2, and set a ship-date target that the team can plan around. Without these three commitments, downstream planning stalls.

    ### Desired outcomes

    - In/out scope list agreed and written into the kickoff doc
    - Engineering capacity commitment logged in the Q2 plan
    - Ship-date target added to the team calendar with dependencies noted

    - **Goal**: Each item on the scope draft marked in, out, or deferred to v2
    - **Pre-read**: [scope draft](https://notion.example/search-scope)

    #### Capacity commitment (20 min). alex

    - **Type**: Decision
    - **Goal**: Eng capacity agreed in sprint-weeks for Q2; risks and backfill plan surfaced
    - **Pre-read**: [capacity model](https://sheets.example/q2-capacity)

    #### Ship-date target (15 min). jonathan

    - **Type**: Decision
    - **Goal**: Target ship date committed with explicit dependencies called out
    - **Pre-read**: none

    #### Next steps (5 min). maria

    - **Type**: Working
    - **Goal**: Owners assigned for follow-up; next sync scheduled

    ### Attendee prep

    **Required prep** (estimated: 8 min)

    - [ ] Read the scope draft and note in/out views. [scope draft](https://notion.example/search-scope)
    - [ ] Review the capacity model and flag any concerns. [capacity model](https://sheets.example/q2-capacity)

    **Recommended context**

    - [Prior user research on search](https://notion.example/search-research): skim the findings summary to understand the customer problem

    **Come ready to**

    - Share your team's Q2 commitments (alex)
    - Weigh in on the scope tradeoff for autocomplete vs. filters (everyone)
    - Flag known dependencies on other teams (alex, sarah)

    ### Parking lot

    ### Logistics

    - **Join link**: https://meet.example/search-kickoff
