# Meeting Recap

!!! info "Quick facts"
    **Classification:** Foundation | **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Category:** meeting | **License:** Apache-2.0

**Try it:** `/meeting-recap "Your context here"`
{ .md-button }

A meeting recap is a post-meeting topic-segmented summary produced for attendees and light distribution. It organizes content by topic rather than chronology, highlights decisions visually, and captures actions inline (with owner, due date, dependencies) per topic segment, plus a consolidated actions view at the end for scannability.

This skill absorbs what would otherwise be a separate "meeting-actions" skill. Actions in this family live alongside the context that makes them meaningful, not in a sibling artifact.

This skill belongs to the Meeting Skills Family. It conforms to the [Meeting Skills Family Contract](../../docs/reference/skill-families/meeting-skills-contract.md).

## When to Use

- After any internal meeting that produces decisions or actions affecting attendees
- When a sibling `/meeting-agenda` exists and needs reconciliation (planned vs. actual topics)
- When the team needs a topic-organized reference rather than a chronological transcript dump
- When inputs include a transcript (Zoom, Meet, Otter, Fireflies, Krisp MCP) or mixed notes and transcript

## When NOT to Use

- Communicating outcomes to non-attendees. Use `/stakeholder-update`. recap assumes reader context; stakeholder-update translates to readers without it.
- Cross-meeting synthesis (patterns across multiple meetings). Use `/meeting-synthesize`.
- Live meeting note-taking. This skill consumes finished inputs; it does not transcribe live.

## How to Use

Use the `/meeting-recap` slash command:

```
/meeting-recap "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/foundation-meeting-recap/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to create a meeting recap, follow these steps:

1. **Parse inputs and detect type**
   Transcript (timestamped speaker-attributed lines), notes (bullet or prose), or hybrid. Note input quality upfront. transcript plus structured notes is high; scrappy bullets is low.

2. **Auto-discover related agenda**
   Look in the same directory for a file matching the pattern `{YYYY-MM-DD}_{HH-MMtimezone}_{title-slug}_agenda.md`. If found, load it. its topic list is the recap's topic skeleton and its `desired_outcomes` drive the meeting-quality reconciliation.

3. **Present go-mode inference summary**
   Show detected meeting date, title, attendees (if inferred), input quality assessment. Accept `go` or corrections.

4. **Topic-segment the content**
   - If agenda was loaded, use its topic list as scaffold (plus any emergent topics)
   - If no agenda, identify topics from transcript discourse markers ("moving on to", "the other thing")

5. **Per topic segment, extract**
   - **Discussion summary**: 2-3 sentences capturing what was discussed
   - **Decisions made**: bold-flagged visually. Never fabricate. if uncertain, flag "appears to have decided X [confidence: medium]"
   - **Actions**: owner + due date + dependencies. Flag missing owners as `[owner: unassigned]` and missing dates as `[due: not specified]`. Never invent.
   - **Open questions**: unresolved items with confidence marker on whether they are truly unresolved or simply not re-raised

6. **Consolidate actions by owner**
   Regroup all actions under each owner. Enables single-owner scan ("what do I owe after this meeting?").

7. **Reconcile agenda** (if agenda loaded)
   - `topics_planned`: from agenda topic list
   - `topics_hit`: topics actually discussed
   - `topics_skipped`: planned but not discussed, with brief reason
   - `topics_emerged`: discussed but not on agenda

8. **Assess meeting quality signals**
   - `outcomes_achieved`: N/M ratio of agenda `desired_outcomes` met (when agenda present)
   - `started_on_time` / `ended_on_time`: from timestamps when available; skipped when not
   - `key_attendees_present`: flag if decision-makers were absent

9. **Surface next steps**
   When we reconvene, what needs to happen on the critical path before that.

10. **Render TEMPLATE.md and validate**
    - Every action's owner appears in `attendees` or is explicitly `unassigned`
    - `meeting_quality.outcomes_achieved` matches `N/M` pattern when populated
    - `agenda_reconciliation` fields present even when empty lists

    ## Shareable summary

    **Search Feature Kickoff** | 2026-04-17
    Scope and capacity agreed; timeline deferred to a follow-up next week due to emergent vendor-contract question on the search provider.

    **Key decisions**:
    - MVP scope: autocomplete + filters IN; saved searches OUT (defer to v2)
    - Q2 eng capacity: 8 sprint-weeks committed; alex owns staffing plan

    **Top actions**:
    - alex: publish sprint-week staffing plan (Due: 2026-04-24)
    - maria: investigate vendor contract constraints on search provider (Due: 2026-04-22)

    ## Full recap

    ### Meeting details

    - **Date**: 2026-04-17
    - **Actual duration**: 68 min (overran by 8 min)
    - **Attendees present**: jonathan, maria, alex, sarah
    - **Attendees absent**: none
    - **Recording**: https://meet.example/search-kickoff/recording

    ### Overall summary

    Agreed on MVP scope (autocomplete + filters in; saved searches deferred) and Q2 engineering capacity (8 sprint-weeks). Timeline commitment deferred to next week because an emergent question on the search-provider vendor contract needs resolution before a date can be committed. Meeting ran 8 minutes over due to the vendor-contract tangent.

    ### Agenda reconciliation

    - **Planned topics**: scope, capacity, timeline, next-steps
    - **Topics addressed**: scope, capacity (2 of 4)
    - **Topics skipped**: timeline. deferred because vendor contract question blocks commitment; next-steps. absorbed into emergent vendor-contract discussion
    - **Topics that emerged**: vendor-contract-review. alex raised a prior email from the search-provider indicating potential licensing limits on usage; needs investigation before timeline is committable

    ### Topics

    #### Scope

    *Type: Decision (from agenda)*

    **Discussion**

    Walked the scope draft together. Autocomplete and filters had clear customer-research backing; saved searches was the contested line. Agreed that saved searches solves a narrower user need and can be deferred without losing the MVP value prop.

    **Decisions made**

    - **MVP scope: autocomplete IN, filters IN, saved searches OUT (defer to v2)**. rationale: autocomplete + filters cover 80% of the research-identified user need; saved searches adds complexity (accounts, persistence) that costs Q2 engineering time without proportional customer-value gain

    **Actions**

    - [ ] maria: update scope doc to reflect decision; circulate for final sign-off by EOD Friday | Due: 2026-04-18 | Dependencies: none
    - [ ] jonathan: add saved-searches to v2 backlog with rationale link | Due: 2026-04-18

    **Open questions**

    - None on scope itself; vendor contract issue (see below) may force scope reconsideration if licensing blocks autocomplete

    ---

    #### Capacity

    *Type: Decision (from agenda)*

    **Discussion**

    Alex walked the Q2 capacity model. 8 sprint-weeks available for search; no backfill needed if scope holds. Flagged that saved-searches would have required 3 additional sprint-weeks, reinforcing the scope decision.

    **Decisions made**

    - **Q2 engineering capacity: 8 sprint-weeks committed to search feature**. rationale: fits within scope agreed in prior topic; no backfill required

    **Actions**

    - [ ] alex: publish detailed sprint-week staffing plan (who, which sprint) | Due: 2026-04-24
    - [ ] alex: flag dependencies on design-system team if any emerge | Due: 2026-04-24

    **Open questions**

    - None

    ---

    #### Vendor-contract-review (emergent)

    *Type: Discussion (emergent. not on agenda)*

    **Discussion**

    Alex surfaced a prior email from the search-provider (Algolia) indicating possible licensing limits on query volume at our projected usage. Raised concern that if limits trigger, we could be forced to renegotiate or re-architect. Decision was to investigate before committing to a ship timeline.

    **Decisions made**

    - **Defer timeline commitment until vendor contract is reviewed** [confidence: high]. rationale: committing a date before vendor-licensing risk is known would create rework

    **Actions**

    - [ ] maria: investigate vendor contract constraints (read licensing terms; query legal if needed) | Due: 2026-04-22 | Dependencies: legal review if terms are ambiguous
    - [ ] jonathan: schedule 30-min follow-up for the week of 2026-04-21 once maria has vendor answer | Due: 2026-04-25

    **Open questions**

    - Does vendor licensing support our projected Q2 query volume? [confidence: high. specific question]
    - If limits apply, are they negotiable or hard? [confidence: medium. depends on legal review]

    ---

    ### All actions (consolidated by owner)

    #### maria

    - [ ] Update scope doc to reflect decision; circulate for final sign-off | Due: 2026-04-18 | Topic: scope

    - [ ] Flag dependencies on design-system team if any emerge | Due: 2026-04-24 | Topic: capacity

    #### jonathan

    - [ ] Add saved-searches to v2 backlog with rationale link | Due: 2026-04-18 | Topic: scope
    - [ ] Schedule 30-min follow-up for week of 2026-04-21 once vendor answer is in | Due: 2026-04-25 | Topic: vendor-contract-review

    ### Meeting quality signals

    - **Outcomes achieved**: 2 of 3 stated outcomes met (scope, capacity; ship-date deferred pending vendor review)
    - **Time management**: Started on time; ended 8 min over due to emergent vendor-contract discussion
    - **Key attendee presence**: All attendees present; decision-maker (jonathan) engaged throughout

    ### Next steps

    - **When we reconvene**: week of 2026-04-21 (30 min, narrow focus: vendor answer + timeline commitment)
    - **What needs to happen first**: maria completes vendor contract investigation
