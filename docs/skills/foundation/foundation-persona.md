# Persona Builder

This skill produces decision-usable personas from one canonical template pack.

## When to Use

- Before drafting PM or GTM artifacts that need a clear persona viewpoint
- When teams disagree on priorities and need behavior-grounded tradeoff framing
- When assumptions and confidence levels must be explicit for decision review
- When tailoring downstream work (PRD, stories, launch, messaging, enablement) to a specific user or buyer profile

## How to Use

Use the `/persona` slash command:

```
/persona "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/foundation-persona/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to generate a persona, follow these steps:

1. **Resolve mode and intent**
   Determine whether the request is `product` or `marketing` (`buyer` alias allowed).
   If mode is omitted, ask for mode selection.
   If execution must continue without reply, default to `product` and state that fallback explicitly.

2. **Collect context and evidence**
   Use user-provided context first (goals, audience, domain, constraints, sources).
   If evidence is thin, continue generation but mark gaps and calibrate confidence.

3. **Select exactly one template**
   Use `references/TEMPLATE.md` and choose exactly one of:
   - `Product Persona Template`
   - `Marketing Persona Template`

4. **Generate a complete artifact**
   Fill the selected template end-to-end:
   - header + one-sentence core-reality statement
   - metadata table
   - `Persona Card`
   - sections `1` through `11`
   - `Evidence & Confidence`

5. **Enforce mode boundaries**
   - Product mode: focus on workflow behavior, decision patterns, friction, quality bar, and product tradeoffs.
   - Marketing mode: focus on buying triggers, evaluation criteria, committee dynamics, objections, messaging, and GTM implications.

6. **Apply evidence and confidence policy**
   - Use `High|Medium|Low` confidence with rationale.
   - Distinguish validated evidence from assumptions.
   - State open questions and governance follow-up.

7. **Finalize for direct use**
   Remove template guidance blockquotes (`>` notes) from the final output.
   Ensure narrative entries are concrete and decision-changing, not placeholder bullets.

## Output Template

# Persona Output Templates (v2.5.0)

Use exactly one template per output:
- `Product Persona Template` for `/persona product`
- `Marketing Persona Template` for `/persona marketing` (and `/persona buyer` alias)

Do not mix sections from both templates in one output.

## Product Persona Template

# [Persona Name] - [Archetype Label]

**[One sentence that captures the persona's core reality: what they do, what's at stake, and what makes their situation distinct.]**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Persona ID | [ PU-### ] |
| Type | [ Primary / Secondary / Supplemental / Negative ] |
| Product scope | [ What areas of the product this persona covers ] |
| Valid for | [ User type, company size, context where this persona applies ] |
| Not valid for | [ Adjacent user types this persona explicitly does not represent ] |
| Confidence | [ Validated / Directional / Proto - with brief evidence basis ] |
| Last validated | [ YYYY-MM-DD ] |
| Owner | [ Team or individual responsible for maintenance ] |

**Quick orientation.** The Persona Card is the daily-use reference - extract it as a standalone one-pager. Sections 1-4 provide context and motivation. Sections 5-8 describe behavior and workflow. Sections 9-11 translate insight into product decisions. Evidence & Confidence calibrates trust.

> **Template note:** Blockquote notes (`>`) are authoring guidance - remove them from the completed persona. Each bolded entry should be 2-4 sentences unless noted otherwise. Tables are reserved for reference data only.

---

## Persona Card

> The daily-use artifact for design reviews, sprint planning, and onboarding. Must fit on one page. Every element must pass the test: would removing this change a product decision? If not, cut it.

**[Persona Name] - [Archetype Label]**
[2-3 sentences describing what this person does, who they serve, and why their relationship with the product domain matters.]

**Key quote:** "[De-identified verbatim quote from research that captures this persona's worldview or core frustration.]"

**Goals.** [3-4 goals as a flowing sentence or short list. Outcomes, not features.]

**Frustrations.** [3-4 behavioral-level frustrations. Problems, not feature requests.]

**Design rules - always.** [3 rules the product must follow for this persona.]

**Design rules - never.** [3 things the product must avoid for this persona.]

## Example Output

??? example "Persona Dossier: Rhea Patel, Keeper of the Approval Chain (Product)"
    # Persona Dossier: Rhea Patel, Keeper of the Approval Chain (Product)

    ## Layer 1: Narrative Persona Dossier

    ## Executive summary
    - Rhea optimizes for defensible execution, not superficial speed.
    - She blocks ambiguous high-impact approvals because late discovery is costlier than early friction.
    - Approval quality is a product surface, not just an operational policy.
    - Exception handling is acceptable only when ownership, reason, expiry, and follow-up are explicit.
    - Teams misread her as conservative when they do not carry downstream accountability.
    - She needs fast decision-quality signals, not verbose status reporting.
    - Contradictory approvals and stale evidence links are top trust-breakers.
    - "Green" status without rationale is functionally a false positive.
    - She values controlled acceleration during deadlines, not process rigidity.
    - Products that preserve legibility under pressure earn sustained sponsorship.

    ### 1) Opening scene
    At 5:37 PM on submission day, the package is marked ready and Slack is celebrating a green status. Rhea opens the final approval thread and finds one high-impact approval with no rationale and one unresolved exception with no owner.

    She pauses release.

    To other teams this looks like delay; to Rhea it is risk containment before cost multiplies downstream.

    ### 2) Who this person is when work gets real
    Rhea runs Clinical Quality Operations in a regulated environment where "done" has legal and operational consequences. She is collaborative and practical, but she has one hard boundary: if a high-risk decision cannot be explained later, the process is not trustworthy.

    She does not optimize for workflow aesthetics. She optimizes for outcomes that survive scrutiny.

    ### 3) Core tension and decision model
    Rhea is not "quality over speed." She is anti-fragile speed. Her operating question is not "how quickly did we ship" but "how many hidden assumptions did we carry to the finish line."

    When information is incomplete, she chooses early clarification over late-stage narrative reconstruction.

    ### 4) Decision moments that define behavior
    - Decision moment A: If evidence is incomplete and accountability is unclear, block and clarify now.
    - Decision moment B: Allow lightweight approval for low-risk edits, but require rationale and confidence for high-impact changes.
    - Decision moment C: Permit scoped exceptions under deadline only when owner, reason, expiry, and follow-up criteria are explicit.

    ### 5) What they say vs what they mean
    | What they say | What they mean | Product implication |
    |---|---|---|
    | "This feels brittle." | A single dependency failure can cascade silently. | Surface dependency and handoff risk early. |
    | "Can we stand behind this?" | Current pass state will fail under scrutiny later. | Require rationale and confidence for high-impact claims. |
    | "Who owns this?" | Accountability is ambiguous right now. | Make ownership explicit in approval and exception flows. |
    | "We are not ready." | It can pass today but fail in review tomorrow. | Align pre-flight and final-gate validation logic. |

    ### 6) Operating modes
    - Normal mode: prioritize throughput while preserving traceability.
    - Compression mode: prioritize controlled acceleration with risk summaries and explicit exception governance.
    - Incident mode: prioritize containment, provenance reconstruction, and clear owner/action mapping.

    ### 7) Product strategy implications
    Priority stack:
    - Decision-quality signals (confidence, rationale, impact cues)
    - Exception governance (owner, reason, expiry, follow-up)
    - Validation parity (same rules in flow and export)
    - Conflict visibility (contradictory approvals, stale references)
    - Human-readable policy explanations (what failed, why, what next)

    Anti-patterns to avoid:
    - Green states that hide unresolved uncertainty
    - Approval models that flatten low-risk and high-risk decisions into one flow

    ### 8) Design principles this persona forces
    - Never show "green" when critical uncertainty is unresolved.
    - Treat approval quality as a first-class UX problem.
    - Design reversible, auditable exception paths.
    - Separate low-risk convenience from high-risk control boundaries.
    - Optimize for cross-role clarity, not only individual speed.

    ### 9) If this persona wins, what changes?
    Teams stop shipping convenience features that collapse under pressure and start shipping systems that remain legible during deadlines, disagreement, and audit. Velocity stays high, but avoidable rework and accountability gaps decline materially.

    ## Layer 2: Operational Appendix

    ### A) Request Context
    - **Mode:** product
    - **Mode alias used:** none
    - **Detail profile:** detailed
    - **Artifact or task context:** improve a regulated approval workflow for `problem-statement`, `prd`, and `edge-cases`
    - **Domain context:** regulated B2B workflow software

    ### B) Depth Guidance
    - **Product detailed:** ~350-900 lines (soft target)
    - **Marketing detailed:** ~340-850 lines (soft target)
    - **Brief profile (either mode):** ~170-360 lines (soft target)
    - **Brief profile:** prioritize decision snapshot and immediate actions
    - **Detailed profile:** include richer tradeoffs, constraints, and edge conditions
    - **If user asks comprehensive/best-in-class:** target upper half of selected range

    ### C) Completeness Floors (Soft)
    - **Product detailed:** 8+ substantive sections, 2+ tables/matrices, 5+ scenario-tailoring entries
    - **Marketing detailed:** 8+ substantive sections, 2+ tables/matrices, 4+ scenario-tailoring entries
    - **Brief profile:** 6-10 executive-summary bullets and 3+ scenario-tailoring entries
    - **All outputs:** sections must be decision-usable; do not ship placeholder-level bullets

    ### D) Includes / Excludes
    - **Includes:** workflow friction, decision triggers, risk posture, product tradeoff direction
    - **Excludes:** campaign messaging strategy, channel planning, non-decision persona trivia

    ### E) Scenario tailoring
    - For `problem-statement`: frame the issue as late discovery and hidden ambiguity in high-stakes approvals.
    - For `prd`: require explicit requirements for rationale capture, exception lifecycle ownership, and validation parity.
    - For `user-stories`: encode accountability semantics (who decides, required evidence, conflict handling, recoverable failure).
    - For `edge-cases`: prioritize contradictory approvals, stale evidence links, ownerless exceptions, and deadline overrides without rationale.
    - For `launch-checklist`: include reviewer enablement, escalation ownership coverage, and rollback readiness for approval-logic regressions.

    ### F) When not to use this persona
    - Do not use for top-of-funnel demand generation strategy.
    - Do not use for consumer UX polish work with no compliance or audit consequence.
    - Do not use for pure brand storytelling disconnected from workflow risk.

    ### G) Assumptions and Confidence
    - **Key assumptions:**
      - Cross-functional approvals are a core business path.
      - Decision provenance is required for audits and escalations.
      - Late-stage rework is materially costly.
      - Reviewer quality is variable under deadline pressure.
    - **Confidence:** Medium
    - **Confidence rationale:** Strong behavioral fit for regulated operations leadership, but weighting should be calibrated with current baseline metrics.
