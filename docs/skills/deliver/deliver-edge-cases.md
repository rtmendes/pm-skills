# Edge Cases

An edge cases document systematically catalogs the unusual, boundary, and error scenarios for a feature. While happy-path flows are typically well-specified, edge cases often get discovered in production — causing bugs, poor user experience, and support burden. Documenting edge cases upfront ensures engineering handles them intentionally and QA knows what to test.

## When to Use

- During feature specification before engineering begins
- When preparing QA test plans
- After discovering production bugs to prevent similar issues
- When reviewing PRDs or user stories for completeness
- Before launch to ensure error states have been designed

## How to Use

Use the `/edge-cases` slash command:

```
/edge-cases "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/deliver-edge-cases/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to document edge cases, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Feature Scope**
   Clearly describe what feature or flow you're analyzing. Edge cases are specific to context — the same input might be valid in one feature and invalid in another.

2. **Walk Through Input Validation**
   Consider every user input: What if it's empty? Too long? Wrong format? Contains special characters? What are the minimum and maximum valid values?

3. **Explore Boundary Conditions**
   Find the edges of acceptable ranges. If a field accepts 1-100, test 0, 1, 100, and 101. Consider pagination boundaries, timeout thresholds, and rate limits.

4. **Map Error States**
   Identify what can go wrong: network failures, permission denied, resource not found, concurrent modifications, expired sessions. Document both the scenario and expected behavior.

5. **Consider Concurrency Issues**
   What if two users act simultaneously? What if the user double-clicks? What if data changes between load and save? Race conditions often cause subtle bugs.

6. **Define Recovery Paths**
   For each error, specify how users recover. What message do they see? Can they retry? Is data preserved? Good error handling turns frustration into confidence.

7. **Prioritize by Likelihood and Impact**
   Not all edge cases need the same attention. High-likelihood + high-impact cases need robust handling; rare + low-impact cases might just need graceful failure.

    | Malware detected | "This file was blocked for security reasons." | [Learn more] |

    ## Recovery Paths

    ### Network Failure During Upload

    **User sees:** Progress bar pauses, toast notification: "Connection lost. Retrying..."

    **Recovery options:**
    1. Automatic retry (3 attempts, 5-second intervals)
    2. Manual retry button after auto-retry exhausted
    3. Cancel upload and start over

    **Data preservation:** Completed file chunks preserved. Upload resumes from last successful chunk.

    ### Storage Quota Exceeded

    **User sees:** Modal: "You've run out of storage space. You're using 10GB of 10GB."

    **Recovery options:**
    1. Click "Manage storage" to delete files
    2. Click "Upgrade plan" for more space
    3. Cancel upload, files not uploaded

    **Data preservation:** No partial upload — check happens before transfer starts.

    ### Session Expired During Long Upload

    **User sees:** Toast: "Your session expired. Please sign in to continue."

    **Recovery options:**
    1. Sign in via modal (doesn't lose page state)
    2. If sign-in succeeds, upload auto-resumes
    3. If sign-in fails, upload cancelled

    **Data preservation:** Upload progress preserved during re-auth attempt.

    ## Test Scenarios

    ### Must Test (P1)

    - [ ] Upload file exactly 100MB — should succeed
    - [ ] Upload file 100MB + 1KB — should fail with size error
    - [ ] Upload 50 files at once — should succeed
    - [ ] Upload 51 files at once — should fail with batch limit error
    - [ ] Disconnect network mid-upload — should pause and recover
    - [ ] Upload .exe disguised as .pdf — should be rejected (MIME check)
    - [ ] Double-click upload button — should only upload once

    ### Should Test (P2)

    - [ ] Upload file with unicode filename — should sanitize
    - [ ] Upload file with 300-character name — should truncate
    - [ ] Upload 0-byte file — should fail
    - [ ] Upload duplicate filename — should auto-rename
    - [ ] Navigate away during upload — should show warning
    - [ ] Storage 99% full, upload 2% of quota — should fail

    ### Nice to Test (P3)

    - [ ] Upload when thumbnail service down — should succeed with generic icon
    - [ ] Two users upload same file simultaneously — both should succeed
    - [ ] Upload file with only extension (.pdf) — should fail

## Quality Checklist
