# Launch Checklist

!!! info "Quick facts"
    **Phase:** Deliver | **Version:** 2.0.0 | **Category:** coordination | **License:** Apache-2.0

**Try it:** `/launch-checklist "Your context here"`
{ .md-button }

A launch checklist is a comprehensive verification document that ensures all functions are ready before releasing a feature or product. It coordinates across engineering, QA, design, marketing, support, legal, and operations to prevent launch-day surprises. Good launch checklists surface blockers early and create shared accountability for launch readiness.

## When to Use

- 1-2 weeks before any significant launch
- During launch planning kickoff meetings
- When coordinating cross-functional releases
- Before major version releases or feature rollouts
- After incidents to improve launch processes

## How to Use

Use the `/launch-checklist` slash command:

```
/launch-checklist "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/deliver-launch-checklist/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to create a launch checklist, follow these steps:

1. **Define Launch Context**
   Document what is launching, when, and who the key stakeholders are. Establish the launch tier (major release, minor feature, experiment) as this affects checklist scope.

2. **Gather Functional Requirements**
   For each function (engineering, QA, marketing, etc.), identify what must be complete, verified, or in place before launch. Distinguish between blockers (must-have) and nice-to-haves.

3. **Assign Owners and Dates**
   Every checklist item needs an owner and a target completion date. Ownership creates accountability; dates enable tracking.

4. **Identify Dependencies and Blockers**
   Flag items that block other work or are blocked by external factors. Surface these early so teams can unblock.

5. **Define Go/No-Go Criteria**
   Establish clear criteria for making the launch decision. What conditions must be met? Who makes the final call?

6. **Document Rollback Plan**
   Every launch should have a rollback strategy. Document how to revert if critical issues emerge post-launch.

7. **Schedule Check-in Cadence**
   Establish when the team will review checklist progress (daily standups, T-2 days review, launch day sync).

    ### Must Have (Blockers)

    - [x] All P0 bugs resolved
    - [x] Security review complete (BLOCKED - scheduled Mar 3-5)
    - [x] Performance benchmarks met
    - [x] UAT sign-off from 10+ stakeholders (8/12 complete)
    - [ ] On-call rotation confirmed for launch week

    - Crash rate >2% (baseline: 0.3%)
    - Error rate >5% on any critical API
    - Major functionality broken (login, task creation, sync)
    - Security vulnerability discovered

    ### Rollback Steps

    1. Disable feature flags (`recurring_tasks_enabled`, `new_nav_enabled`)
    2. If flag disable insufficient: Push App Store emergency update reverting to v2.9
    3. Communicate to users via in-app banner and email
    4. Post incident channel update (#launch-v3-war-room)

    ### Rollback Owner

    David Park . david@taskflow.io . +1-555-0123

    | Security review not yet started | Security Team | Scheduled Mar 3 | BLOCKER - must complete before launch |
    | 4 UAT stakeholders haven't responded | Sarah Chen | Following up | Risk - need sign-offs by Mar 5 |
    | Android 14 notification permission edge case | David Park | Investigating | Low - affects <1% users |
    | Marketing screenshots delayed | Design Team | In Progress | Risk - app store update may slip |

## Real-World Examples

See this skill applied to three different product contexts:

??? example "Storevine (B2B): Storevine B2B ecommerce platform . Campaigns v1 GA launch checklist"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /launch-checklist

    Feature: Campaigns v1.0 . native email marketing for Storevine merchants
    Launch date: April 28, 2026
    Launch type: Major Release
    Launch owner: Growth PM

    Key compliance and infrastructure requirements:
    - Legal sign-off on CAN-SPAM + GDPR required before any production send
    - DMARC/SPF/DKIM sender authentication required for Gmail/Yahoo inbox
      delivery (enforced by Google and Yahoo since 2024)
    - SendGrid dedicated IP warm-up plan needed before full-volume sends
    - Feature flag rollout: start at 10% of merchants [fictional], scale
      to 100% over 2 weeks based on send failure rates

    Stakeholders:
    - Engineering Lead (Platform Squad)
    - Merchant Success (launch comms + support)
    - Legal (CAN-SPAM/GDPR review)
    - Storevine Marketing (announcement + dog-food)

    Key risks from stakeholder summary:
    - Legal review not started; hard gate on compliance sign-off
    - Klaviyo partner team needs 48-hour advance notice before GA announcement
    - Power-user merchant beta cohort expectations may exceed v1 scope

    Need: full pre-launch checklist with go/no-go criteria, rollback plan,
    and check-in schedule.

    # Launch Checklist: Resurface . Morning Email Digest

??? example "Workbench (Enterprise): Workbench enterprise collaboration platform - Blueprints v1 GA launch readiness checklist"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /launch-checklist

    I need a comprehensive launch checklist for Blueprints v1 GA. Here's the context:

    **Launch details:**
    - Launch name: Blueprints GA
    - Target date: April 28, 2026
    - Rollout: From 80 closed-beta accounts to all ~500 enterprise customers [fictional]
    - Ship decision confirmed by Sandra C. on April 14, 2026

    **Key stakeholders:**
    - Rachel V. (PM), Karen L. (Eng Lead), Tomás G. (Design Lead), Derek H. (Head of Marketing), Mei-Lin T. (Enterprise Sales Lead), James W. (VP Eng)

    **Critical items I'm tracking:**
    - SAML SSO certification -- must be complete before GA (enterprise blocker)
    - IT admin provisioning guide -- enterprise security teams need this before they'll onboard
    - Confluence migration communication plan -- many prospects are switching from Confluence
    - A/B test code cleanup -- remove experiment flags, ship required-sections as default
    - WebSocket provider scaling -- validated at 80 accounts, need to load test for 500

    **Rollback concern:** If a critical bug surfaces in the first 48 hours, we need a clean rollback to the pre-Blueprints state without data loss for accounts that already created Blueprints during GA.

    Please generate the full launch checklist with go/no-go criteria and a rollback plan.
    ```

    **Output:**

    # Launch Checklist: Blueprints v1 GA
