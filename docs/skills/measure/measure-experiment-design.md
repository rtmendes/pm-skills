# Experiment Design

!!! info "Quick facts"
    **Phase:** Measure | **Version:** 2.0.0 | **Category:** validation | **License:** Apache-2.0

**Try it:** `/experiment-design "Your context here"`
{ .md-button }

An experiment design document defines all parameters needed to run a rigorous A/B test or controlled experiment. It ensures the team aligns on what you're testing, how you'll measure success, and how long to run the test before drawing conclusions. Good experiment design prevents common pitfalls: underpowered tests, unclear success criteria, and decisions based on noise rather than signal.

## When to Use

- Before launching an A/B test to validate a product change
- When testing a hypothesis that requires quantitative validation
- After solution design to validate assumptions before full rollout
- When stakeholders want data-driven evidence for a decision
- To establish a culture of experimentation and learning

## How to Use

Use the `/experiment-design` slash command:

```
/experiment-design "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/measure-experiment-design/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to design an experiment, follow these steps:

1. **Articulate the Hypothesis**
   Write a clear, testable hypothesis in the format: "We believe [change] for [users] will [outcome] as measured by [metric]." One hypothesis per experiment . if you're testing multiple things, run multiple experiments.

2. **Define the Variants**
   Describe the control (current experience) and treatment (new experience) in sufficient detail. Include screenshots, mockups, or precise descriptions so anyone can understand what users will see.

3. **Choose Primary and Secondary Metrics**
   Select one primary metric that will determine success or failure. Add 2-3 secondary metrics to understand the broader impact. Include guardrail metrics to catch unintended negative effects.

4. **Calculate Sample Size**
   Determine how many users you need per variant to detect your minimum detectable effect (MDE) with statistical significance. Specify your significance level (typically 0.05) and power (typically 0.80).

5. **Estimate Duration**
   Based on sample size and available traffic, calculate how long the experiment needs to run. Account for weekly patterns . avoid ending mid-week if behavior varies by day.

6. **Define Targeting and Allocation**
   Specify which users are eligible for the experiment and how traffic is split between variants. Document any exclusions (e.g., employees, specific segments).

7. **Set Success Criteria**
   Define upfront what constitutes a win, a loss, or an inconclusive result. This prevents post-hoc rationalization and moving goalposts.

8. **Document Risks and Mitigations**
   Identify what could go wrong and how you'll detect/address it. Include monitoring plans and rollback criteria.

## Example Output

??? example "Experiment Design: One-Page Checkout"
    # Experiment Design: One-Page Checkout

    ## Overview

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | **Experiment Name** | checkout-single-page-v1 |
    | **Owner** | Maria Santos, Product Manager |
    | **Start Date** | January 20, 2026 |
    | **End Date** | February 3, 2026 |
    | **Status** | Ready |

    ## Hypothesis

    **We believe** replacing our 3-step checkout with a single-page checkout

    **for** mobile web users

    **will** increase checkout completion rate

    **as measured by** checkout conversion rate (orders / checkout starts)

    ## Background

    Mobile checkout abandonment is at 73%, compared to 45% on desktop. User research identified friction points: confusion navigating between steps, anxiety about hidden costs appearing late in the flow, and form field frustration on small screens. A single-page checkout addresses these by showing all information upfront and reducing navigation.

    Competitor analysis shows that Amazon, Shopify stores, and Apple use single-page or minimal-step checkouts. Our hypothesis is that reducing cognitive load and providing visibility into the full process will improve conversion.

    ## Variants

    ### Control (A)

    **Description:** Current 3-step checkout flow

    **Details:**
    - Step 1: Shipping address entry
    - Step 2: Shipping method selection + payment information
    - Step 3: Order review and confirmation
    - Each step loads a new page
    - Progress indicator shows current step

    **Screenshot/Mockup:** [designs/checkout-control-v3.png]

    ### Treatment (B)

    **Description:** Single-page checkout with accordion sections

    **Details:**
    - All sections visible on one page (shipping, payment, review)
    - Accordion UI: one section expanded at a time, others collapsed but visible
    - Express payment buttons (Apple Pay, Google Pay) at top
    - Shipping cost shown immediately based on cart
    - Edit any section without losing data

    **Screenshot/Mockup:** [designs/checkout-treatment-v2.png]

    ## Metrics

    ### Primary Metric

    | Metric | Definition | Current Baseline | Minimum Detectable Effect |
    |--------|------------|------------------|---------------------------|
    | Checkout conversion rate | Orders completed / Checkout sessions started | 27% | 5% relative (1.35 pp absolute) |

    ### Secondary Metrics

    | Metric | Definition | Purpose |
    |--------|------------|---------|
    | Checkout completion time | Median seconds from checkout start to order | Confirm UX improvement |
    | Express payment usage | % of orders via Apple Pay / Google Pay | Track new feature adoption |
    | Cart abandonment rate | Carts abandoned before checkout start | Ensure we're not shifting drop-off |

    ### Guardrail Metrics

    | Metric | Definition | Threshold |
    |--------|------------|-----------|
    | Average order value | Total revenue / Orders | Must not decrease by more than 2% |
    | Payment failure rate | Failed payments / Payment attempts | Must not increase by more than 1pp |
    | Support tickets (checkout) | CS tickets tagged "checkout" | Must not increase by more than 20% |

    ## Sample Size & Duration

    ### Sample Size Calculation

    | Parameter | Value |
    |-----------|-------|
    | **Baseline conversion rate** | 27% |
    | **Minimum detectable effect (MDE)** | 5% relative (28.35% target) |
    | **Statistical significance (alpha)** | 0.05 (one-tailed) |
    | **Statistical power (1-beta)** | 0.80 |
    | **Users per variant** | 9,800 |
    | **Total users needed** | 19,600 |

    Calculation performed using Evan Miller's sample size calculator, assuming one-tailed test (we only ship if treatment is better).

    ### Duration Estimate

    | Parameter | Value |
    |-----------|-------|
    | **Daily eligible traffic** | 18,000 mobile checkout sessions/day |
    | **Traffic allocation** | 80% to experiment (20% holdout for safety) |
    | **Users per day in experiment** | 14,400 |
    | **Minimum duration** | 2 days to reach sample size |
    | **Recommended duration** | 14 days to capture weekly patterns and ensure stability |

    We're running for 14 days despite reaching sample size in 2 days to:
    - Capture full weekly shopping patterns (weekday vs. weekend)
    - Allow time to detect delayed effects on returns/chargebacks
    - Ensure novelty effect wears off

    ## Audience Targeting

    ### Inclusion Criteria

    - Logged-in or guest users
    - Mobile web (not native apps . app experiment runs separately)
    - Users in US and Canada (payment methods configured)
    - Cart value >= $10 (exclude micro-purchases)

    ### Exclusion Criteria

    - Employees (identified by email domain)
    - Users enrolled in conflicting experiments (cart-upsell-test, payment-method-test)
    - Users who have participated in checkout experiments in past 30 days

    ### Traffic Allocation

    | Variant | Allocation |
    |---------|------------|
    | Control (A) | 50% |
    | Treatment (B) | 50% |

    ## Success Criteria

    ### Win (Ship Treatment)

    Primary metric (checkout conversion) improves by >= 5% relative with p < 0.05, AND:
    - Average order value does not decrease by more than 2%
    - Payment failure rate does not increase by more than 1pp
    - No critical bugs or UX issues identified

    **Action:** Roll out to 100% of mobile web, begin desktop adaptation.

    ### Loss (Keep Control)

    Any of:
    - Checkout conversion decreases with p < 0.05
    - Any guardrail metric breaches threshold
    - Critical UX issues discovered affecting > 1% of users

    **Action:** Revert to control, analyze learnings, iterate on design.

    ### Inconclusive (More Data Needed)

    Primary metric change is between -5% and +5% relative and not statistically significant after 14 days.

    **Action:** Extend experiment to 21 days if traffic allows. If still inconclusive, treat as neutral and decide based on qualitative factors (user feedback, operational simplicity).

    ## Risks & Mitigations

    | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
    |------|------------|--------|------------|
    | Apple Pay integration issues | Medium | High | Test extensively in staging; 5% initial ramp with monitoring |
    | Page load performance degradation | Low | Medium | Performance budget enforced; lazy-load payment forms |
    | Users confused by accordion UX | Low | Medium | Added progress indicators and clear "Continue" buttons |
    | Increased payment failures | Low | High | Same payment provider; monitor failure rate hourly |

    ### Monitoring Plan

    - **Real-time dashboard:** Checkout funnel by variant, updated every 5 minutes
    - **Alert thresholds:**
      - Payment failure rate > 5% in any 1-hour window
      - Checkout conversion drops > 20% relative to control
      - Error rate > 1% on any checkout action
    - **Rollback criteria:** Any alert sustained for 30 minutes triggers automatic rollback
    - **Daily check-ins:** Team reviews metrics at 10am daily for first 5 days

    ## Implementation Notes

    - Feature flag: `checkout_single_page_v1` in LaunchDarkly
    - Instrumentation: New events `checkout_section_opened`, `checkout_section_completed` for funnel analysis
    - Cache invalidation: Clear checkout page cache at experiment start
    - Mobile detection: User-Agent parsing; tablet = desktop experience

## Real-World Examples

See this skill applied to three different product contexts:

??? example "Storevine (B2B): Storevine B2B ecommerce platform . Campaigns guided first-campaign flow A/B experiment design"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /experiment-design

    Project: Campaigns . Campaigns guided first-campaign flow
    Experiment: Does the guided first-campaign flow increase first-send rate
                for non-adopter merchants?

    Hypothesis (from Define phase doc):
    - We believe pre-populated templates for non-adopter merchants (<250
      customers [fictional], no external email tool) will drive first-send
      rate from 12% [fictional] to ≥30% [fictional] within 60 days of GA

    Variants:
    - Control: Standard Campaigns creation flow (blank template editor,
      named segment library, no pre-population)
    - Treatment: Guided first-campaign flow (product-seeded template,
      audience defaulted to "Customers who purchased in the last 90 days")

    Sample: ~6,800 eligible non-adopter merchants [fictional]; need enough
      per variant to detect a 8 pp improvement with 80% power

    Run period: April 28 – June 27, 2026 (60 days from GA)

    Need: full experiment design with sample size calculation, success
    criteria, risks, and implementation notes.

    # Experiment Design: Guided First-Campaign Flow for Non-Adopter Merchants

??? example "Brainshelf (Consumer): Brainshelf consumer PKM app . Resurface A/B test experiment design"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /experiment-design

    resurface a/b test. feature is shipped behind a flag. need the full
    experiment design for chloe to set up in amplitude.

    hypothesis: daily digest → higher 7-day return rate.

    design: intent-to-treat. treatment gets the opt-in prompt + digest.
    control gets nothing (current experience). measure 7-day return rate
    for both groups.

    secondary metric: email CTR (treatment only . control doesn't get
    email). guardrail: unsub rate ≤2%/week.

    sample: 400 per variant from the 9,800 eligible users [fictional].
    duration: 4 weeks (mar 9 - apr 5). 50/50 split on enrollment cohort.

    want to have the design doc locked before the setup week (mar 2-8).

??? example "Workbench (Enterprise): Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: Blueprints required vs. optional sections A/B test"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /experiment-design

    Experiment: Required vs. optional Blueprint sections
    Product: Workbench Blueprints (enterprise doc templates with approval gates)
    Stage: Closed beta shipped; need to A/B test before expanding to full 500-customer base [fictional]

    Context:
    - Blueprints allows admins to create doc templates with sections
    - Currently all sections are optional -- authors can submit incomplete Blueprints for approval
    - Data: 38% of Blueprints reach approval with ≥1 empty section [fictional]; most rejections are for missing content, not quality
    - Hypothesis from Define phase: making sections required (must complete before submitting) reduces time to first approval
    - Baseline: median time to first approved Blueprint = 4.0 days [fictional]
    - Goal: reduce to ≤2.5 days [fictional]

    Treatment: Required sections -- authoring UI blocks submission if any required section is empty. Show inline validation message, highlight empty sections.
    Control: Current optional sections -- authors can submit with empty sections as today.

    Primary metric: median time-to-first-approval (days)
    Secondary: approval rejection rate, Blueprint completion rate
    Guardrail: don't tank author-side NPS or increase abandonment

    Audience: Project leads at enterprise customers in closed beta (excludes IT admins and approvers).
    Stakeholders: Head of Product, Data Science, Engineering Lead (Blueprints)
    ```
