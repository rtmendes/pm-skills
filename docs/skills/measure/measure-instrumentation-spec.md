# Instrumentation Spec

An instrumentation spec defines what analytics events to track, when to fire them, and what properties to include. It serves as a contract between product and engineering, ensuring consistent data collection that enables accurate measurement. Good instrumentation specs prevent the "we can't answer that question because we didn't track it" problem.

## When to Use

- Before engineering implements a new feature
- When defining analytics requirements for experiments
- When auditing existing tracking for gaps or inconsistencies
- When onboarding a new analytics tool
- Before launch to ensure measurement is in place

## How to Use

Use the `/instrumentation-spec` slash command:

```
/instrumentation-spec "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/measure-instrumentation-spec/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to create an instrumentation spec, follow these steps:

1. **Define Analytics Goals**
   Start with the questions you need to answer. What will you measure? What decisions will this data inform? This prevents over-instrumentation while ensuring nothing important is missed.

2. **Identify Events to Track**
   List each user action or system event that should be tracked. Follow consistent naming conventions (typically `noun_verb` or `verb_noun` in snake_case). Each event should represent a distinct, meaningful action.

3. **Specify Event Triggers**
   For each event, describe exactly when it fires. Be precise: "When user clicks Submit button" vs. "When form is submitted successfully." These are different events with different meanings.

4. **Define Event Properties**
   List the properties (attributes) attached to each event. Include property name, data type, description, and example values. Properties provide context that makes events useful.

5. **Document User Properties**
   Identify persistent user-level attributes that should be associated with all events (e.g., subscription tier, account creation date). These enable segmentation in analysis.

6. **Address PII and Privacy**
   Flag any properties that contain personally identifiable information. Document how PII should be handled — hashing, encryption, or exclusion.

7. **Create Testing Checklist**
   Define how QA should verify that tracking is implemented correctly. Include steps to validate events fire at the right times with correct properties.

    | team_member_emails | Email addresses | Do not send to analytics; count only |
    | full_name | Name | Do not send to analytics |

    ### Consent Requirements

    - Analytics events only sent if user has accepted analytics cookies (GDPR)
    - `onboarding_started` includes consent check; if denied, no events fire
    - Users can opt out via Settings > Privacy, which sets `analytics_opt_out` user property

    ### Data Retention

    - Event data retained for 24 months
    - User properties retained for account lifetime
    - PII hashes cannot be reversed; original values stored only in primary database

    ## Implementation Notes

    ### SDK/Integration

    - **Platform:** Web (React)
    - **SDK:** Amplitude JavaScript SDK v8.21.0
    - **Initialization:** Initialize on app load, identify user after authentication

    ### Event Timing

    - Events should fire immediately on trigger, not batched
    - If offline, queue events and send on reconnection
    - Time properties (time_on_step) calculated client-side using performance.now()

    ### Code Reference

    ```javascript
    // Example event call
    amplitude.track('onboarding_step_completed', {
      step_number: 2,
      step_name: 'profile_setup',
      time_on_step: calculateTimeOnStep(),
      was_skipped: false,
      completion_method: 'manual'
    });
    ```

    ## Testing Checklist

    ### Event Validation

    - [ ] **onboarding_started:** Create new account, verify event fires on welcome screen with correct source
    - [ ] **onboarding_step_viewed:** Navigate through each step, verify event fires for each with correct step_number
    - [ ] **onboarding_step_completed:** Complete profile step, verify event fires with time_on_step > 0
    - [ ] **onboarding_step_skipped:** Skip integrations step, verify event fires with step_name = "integrations"
    - [ ] **onboarding_integration_connected:** Connect Slack, verify event fires with integration_name = "slack"
    - [ ] **onboarding_completed:** Complete full flow, verify event fires with accurate total_time
    - [ ] **onboarding_abandoned:** Start onboarding, close browser, verify event fires after 30 min timeout

    ### Property Validation

    - [ ] Verify step_number is integer 1-5, never 0 or > 5
    - [ ] Verify time_on_step is positive number, never negative
    - [ ] Verify completion_path format matches "done|skip" comma-separated pattern
    - [ ] Verify is_return_visit correctly detects revisiting completed steps

    ### Edge Cases

    - [ ] Verify events fire correctly after page refresh mid-onboarding
    - [ ] Verify events fire correctly after session timeout and re-login
    - [ ] Verify events do not duplicate if user navigates back and forward
    - [ ] Verify onboarding_abandoned does not fire if user completes

    ### Debug Tools

    - Access Amplitude debug panel: append `?amplitude_debug=true` to URL
    - View events in browser console: `amplitude.getInstance().logLevel = 'DEBUG'`
    - Validate in Amplitude: User Lookup > search by user_id > Event Stream

## Real-World Examples

See this skill applied to three different product contexts:

??? example "Storevine (B2B): Storevine B2B ecommerce platform — Campaigns send flow and first-campaign flow analytics instrumentation"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /instrumentation-spec

    Feature: Campaigns — campaign send flow + guided first-campaign flow
    Analytics platform: Amplitude

    Events I need to instrument:
    1. campaign_created — merchant saves a campaign draft
    2. campaign_sent — merchant sends a campaign
    3. first_send_completed — merchant sends their FIRST campaign ever
       (milestone event for the non-adopter hypothesis)
    4. attribution_recorded — a purchase is linked to a campaign click
       within the 7-day attribution window

    Prior work:
    - Experiment design: A/B test using first_send_completed as primary metric
    - Spike summary: SendGrid webhook attribution confirmed; unique_args
      includes campaign_id, merchant_id, recipient_customer_id

    PII note: Subscriber email addresses must NOT be sent to Amplitude.
    Only customer_id (pseudonymous internal identifier).

    Need: full instrumentation spec with event definitions, properties,
    PII handling, implementation notes, and QA testing checklist.

    # Instrumentation Spec: Campaigns Send Flow and First-Campaign Flow

??? example "Brainshelf (Consumer): Brainshelf consumer PKM app — Resurface feature analytics instrumentation spec"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /instrumentation-spec

    resurface analytics events for amplitude. need the full spec before
    sprint 8 starts so alex and jess can instrument during the build.

    events:
    1. resurface_opt_in — user enables the digest
    2. resurface_digest_sent — server sends a digest email
    3. resurface_digest_opened — user opens the email (caveat: apple MPP)
    4. resurface_item_clicked — user clicks an item in the digest
    5. resurface_unsubscribe — user unsubscribes
    6. resurface_cadence_changed — user changes frequency
    7. resurface_digest_skipped — server skips sending (no qualifying items,
       exclusion window exhausted, etc.)

    also need user properties: digest_enabled, digest_cadence, digest_timezone.

    keep it tight. chloe wants to review before sprint planning on monday.

    # Instrumentation Spec: Resurface Digest

??? example "Workbench (Enterprise): Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: Blueprints v1 GA instrumentation spec"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /instrumentation-spec

    I need the instrumentation spec for Blueprints v1 GA. Here are the events I've identified from the PRD and experiment results:

    **Core lifecycle events:**
    1. `blueprint_created` -- when an author creates a new Blueprint from a template
    2. `section_completed` -- when a required section transitions from empty to non-empty
    3. `section_cleared` -- when a required section transitions from non-empty to empty
    4. `approval_requested` -- when an author submits a Blueprint for approval
    5. `approval_granted` -- when an approver approves a Blueprint
    6. `approval_rejected` -- when an approver rejects a Blueprint
    7. `blueprint_published` -- when an approved Blueprint is published to the team workspace

    **Key properties I need on each event:**
    - Standard: account_id, user_id, blueprint_id, template_id, timestamp
    - blueprint_created: creation_method (wizard/canvas), template_name, required_section_count, optional_section_count
    - section_completed/cleared: section_id, section_name, is_required, word_count
    - approval events: approval_chain_type (sequential/parallel), approver_position, approval_cycle_number
    - blueprint_published: time_to_approved_hours, total_approval_cycles, co_editor_count

    **PII concerns:**
    - user_id is internal (UUID), not PII
    - We must NOT capture section content in events -- only metadata
    - Account names should not appear in event properties; use account_id only

    **SDK:** Workbench Analytics SDK (server-side collector, JavaScript client)

    Please generate the full instrumentation spec with testing checklist.
    ```

    **Output:**

    # Instrumentation Spec: Workbench Blueprints v1
