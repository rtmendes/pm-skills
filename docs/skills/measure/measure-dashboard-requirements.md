# Dashboard Requirements

A dashboard requirements document specifies what questions a dashboard should answer, what metrics it displays, and how data should be visualized. Clear requirements help data teams build dashboards that actually inform decisions rather than just displaying numbers.

## When to Use

- When requesting a new dashboard from data/analytics teams
- To define KPI tracking for a product, feature, or team
- When formalizing ad-hoc reporting into a persistent dashboard
- Before quarterly planning to specify what visibility you need
- When onboarding stakeholders who need self-serve analytics

## How to Use

Use the `/dashboard-requirements` slash command:

```
/dashboard-requirements "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/measure-dashboard-requirements/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to specify dashboard requirements, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Purpose**
   Start with the questions this dashboard should answer, not the charts it should show. What decisions will this dashboard inform? A dashboard without clear purpose becomes a vanity metrics display.

2. **Identify the Audience**
   Specify who will use this dashboard, how often, and in what context. An executive weekly review has different needs than a team's daily standup board.

3. **Specify Key Metrics**
   For each metric, document: name, business definition (in plain language), calculation formula, data source, and baseline/target values. Ambiguous metrics lead to misaligned dashboards.

4. **Design Visualizations**
   Recommend chart types based on what the data should communicate. Time trends need line charts; comparisons need bar charts; compositions need pie/treemaps. Include dimension breakdowns.

5. **Define Filters and Segments**
   Specify what drill-downs users need: date ranges, user segments, product areas, geographic regions. Anticipate the "slice and dice" questions users will ask.

6. **Document Data Sources**
   Identify where data comes from and any known data quality issues. Note latency requirements—does the dashboard need real-time data or is daily refresh sufficient?

7. **Set Permissions and Access**
   Determine who can view what. Some metrics may need restricted access. Consider both security requirements and organizational politics.

    |--------------|------------|----------|
    | New Users | Signed up within last 30 days | Track onboarding effectiveness |
    | At-Risk | No login in 14+ days but not churned | Target for re-engagement |

    ---

    ## Data Sources

    ### Primary Sources

    | Source | Type | Owner | Latency | Quality Notes |
    |--------|------|-------|---------|---------------|
    | events.user_actions | Snowflake table | Data Engineering | 1 hour | 99.9% complete |
    | events.feature_usage | Snowflake table | Data Engineering | 1 hour | Some features not instrumented |
    | users.signups | Snowflake table | Data Engineering | Real-time | Authoritative source |
    | users.subscriptions | Snowflake table | Data Engineering | Daily | Synced from Stripe |

    ### Data Pipeline Requirements

    **Refresh Frequency:** Hourly during business hours, daily overnight
    **Refresh Time:** Dashboard current as of top-of-hour; overnight refresh complete by 6am UTC
    **Historical Data Needed:** Last 24 months
    **Data Retention:** Aggregated data retained indefinitely; raw events 24 months

    ### Data Quality Considerations

    - Bot traffic filtered but occasional false positives; flag if DAU spikes >20% unexpectedly
    - Feature usage for "Reports" feature incomplete before Nov 2025 (instrumentation added)
    - Enterprise accounts have multiple users; user_id is individual, account_id needed for account-level views
