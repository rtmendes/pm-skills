# Slideshow Creator

!!! info "Quick facts"
    **Classification:** Utility | **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Category:** communication | **License:** Apache-2.0

**Try it:** `/slideshow-creator "Your context here"`
{ .md-button }

Generate professional presentations (.pptx and .pdf) from a JSON deck specification. Zero design decisions at generation time . Claude selects slide types and fills content slots; all visual properties are pre-decided by the theme.

## When to Use

- Creating slide decks for stakeholder updates, product reviews, team presentations
- Generating professional .pptx files from content briefs
- Producing consistent presentations without manual formatting
- Exporting presentations to PDF for sharing or archiving

## When NOT to Use

- Creating complex data visualizations (use dedicated charting tools)
- Building interactive web presentations (this produces .pptx, not HTML)
- Editing existing PowerPoint files (this creates new decks from scratch)

## How to Use

Use the `/slideshow-creator` slash command:

```
/slideshow-creator "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/utility-slideshow-creator/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

1. **Read the content brief** . Understand topic, audience, length, specific requirements
2. **Plan the deck** . Select slide types using the decision logic table. Assign dark/light variants for visual rhythm (alternate to avoid monotony).
3. **Write the JSON deck specification** . Fill content slots, respecting character limits from `references/slide-types.md`
4. **Run the generation script** . `node scripts/generate-deck.js deck-spec.json`
5. **Optionally export PDF** . `node scripts/export-pdf.mjs deck-spec.json output.pdf`
6. **Report the output** . Tell the user where the file(s) are

## Example Output

??? example "Example: Q3 Product Update Deck"
    # Example: Q3 Product Update Deck

    This example walks through creating a 9-slide product update deck for an engineering all-hands meeting, demonstrating the spec-writing workflow from content brief to JSON output.

    ## Content Brief

    The product team needs a deck for the Q3 engineering all-hands covering:
    - Customer satisfaction hit a record high (94%)
    - Three major features shipped (real-time analytics dashboard, API rate limiting, bulk data import)
    - Revenue grew 18% quarter-over-quarter
    - Roadmap preview for Q4 (3 milestones)
    - Key insight: teams using the analytics dashboard have 2.4x faster incident response times

    ## Deck Planning

    ### Slide Type Selection

    | # | Content | Type | Variant | Rationale |
    |---|---------|------|---------|-----------|
    | 1 | Opening | title_dark | dark | Bold external opener |
    | 2 | Section: Metrics | section | dark | Topic transition |
    | 3 | CSAT record | stat | light | Single metric spotlight |
    | 4 | Revenue comparison | dual_stat | dark | Two numbers gain from comparison |
    | 5 | Features shipped | bullets | light | 3-6 point list |
    | 6 | Feature details | three_card | dark | Three parallel concepts |
    | 7 | Key insight | highlight | light | Executive takeaway |
    | 8 | Q4 roadmap | timeline | light | Chronological milestones |
    | 9 | Close | closing | dark | Standard ending |

    ### Variant Check

    Dark-light alternation: D, D, L, D, L, D, L, L, D -- slight imbalance at slides 7-8 (both light) but acceptable because highlight and timeline are visually distinct types.

    ## What This Deck Demonstrates

    - **Line break control:** Title slide uses `\n` to split "Q3 Product" and "Update" onto separate lines for deliberate text wrapping
    - **Section dividers:** The section slide creates a clear visual break before the metrics block, signaling a topic change to the audience
    - **Single vs comparative metrics:** `stat` spotlights one number (CSAT score) while `dual_stat` places two numbers side-by-side for direct comparison (Q2 vs Q3 revenue)
    - **Parallel structure:** `three_card` gives equal visual weight to three shipped features, avoiding the implicit ranking that a bullet list creates
    - **Highlight restraint:** `highlight` is used exactly once for the strongest finding -- overuse dilutes its impact
    - **Chronological milestones:** `timeline` presents Q4 roadmap items in calendar order, making sequencing and dependencies visible
    - **Speaker notes on every slide:** Notes provide presenter context without cluttering the slide surface -- especially useful for stakeholder decks that get forwarded without the presenter
    - **Dark/light rhythm:** Variants alternate to maintain visual energy; the consecutive light slides (7-8) work because highlight and timeline have distinct visual structures
    - **Character-limit compliance:** All content respects the limits defined in slide-types.md -- titles stay concise, bullets stay scannable, and the highlight sentence remains under the maximum length

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Every slide has a valid type key (one of the 18 defined types)
- [ ] All content slots respect character limits from `references/slide-types.md`
- [ ] Dark/light variants alternate for visual rhythm (no 3+ consecutive same-variant slides)
- [ ] Deck has a title slide (first) and a closing slide (last)
- [ ] Section dividers separate distinct topics in decks > 6 slides
- [ ] Speaker notes included for key slides (stats, highlights, transitions)
- [ ] JSON is valid (no trailing commas, proper quoting, correct nesting)
- [ ] Color values are valid theme tokens or 6-character hex strings (no `#` prefix)

## Output Contract

- **Planning artifact**: JSON deck specification (the file Claude writes)
- **Final output**: .pptx file (+ optional .pdf), generated locally from the spec
- **Quality gate**: All items in the quality checklist pass
