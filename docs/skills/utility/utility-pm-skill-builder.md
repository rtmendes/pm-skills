# PM Skill Builder

This skill creates new PM skills for the pm-skills library. It produces a
Skill Implementation Packet — a complete design document with draft files —
in a staging area for review before promotion to canonical locations.

## When to Use

- When you have an idea for a new PM skill
- When you want to add a domain skill (phase-specific), foundation skill
  (cross-cutting), or utility skill (meta/tooling) to the pm-skills library
- When a contributor needs guided skill creation that follows repo conventions

## When NOT to Use

- To modify an existing skill → use a future validation/iteration utility (planned)
- To create a skill for a non-pm-skills context → use a general agent skill builder (planned)
- To create a workflow bundle → bundles are authored directly, not via this builder

## How to Use

Use the `/pm-skill-builder` slash command:

```
/pm-skill-builder "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/utility-pm-skill-builder/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to create a new PM skill, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Idea

Accept the idea in either form:
- **Problem-first**: "What PM problem does this skill solve? Who runs into
  this problem, and what do they currently produce (or fail to produce)?"
- **Skill-first**: "Describe the skill you want to create. What artifact
  does it produce? What PM activity does it support?"

Both entry points produce the same downstream flow. If the user provides
one form, do not ask for the other — extract what you need and proceed.

If the idea is vague, ask ONE follow-up question to clarify the artifact
type and target audience before proceeding.

### Step 2: Gap Analysis

Check ALL existing skills for overlap. Use the Current Library Reference
table below AND scan the `skills/` directory for the latest inventory.

Present findings with specificity:
- Name each overlapping skill and explain what it covers
- Identify the specific gap this new skill would fill
- If overlap is high, trigger the Why Gate (see below)

**Why Gate** (triggers when overlap is found):
Ask the user: "Name 2-3 specific prompts or scenarios where the existing
skills fail to produce what you need."

**Kill Gate**: If the user cannot articulate convincing gaps, recommend
an alternative:
- "Revise [existing skill] to cover this case"
- "Create a bundle combining [skill A] + [skill B]"
- "Add a command variant, not a new skill"
- "This is a documentation improvement, not a new skill"

Do not proceed past the kill gate without either convincing evidence of
a gap or explicit user override.

### Step 3: Scope Check

Evaluate whether the idea should be ONE skill or MULTIPLE skills.

**Splitting signals:**
- The idea produces multiple distinct artifact types
- The idea crosses Triple Diamond phases (e.g., Discover + Deliver)
- The description naturally contains "and" connecting two activities

If splitting is warranted, present the recommendation:
"This seems to cover two distinct PM activities:
  1. [Activity A] → produces [Artifact A]
  2. [Activity B] → produces [Artifact B]
These work better as separate skills that can be chained via a bundle.
Want to proceed with just [Activity A] for now?"

### Step 4: Classification + Repo-Fit

Determine the skill's classification and naming:

**Domain skills** (phase-specific PM activities):
- Phase: discover | define | develop | deliver | measure | iterate
- Directory: `{phase}-{skill-name}`
- Frontmatter: `phase: {phase}` (required), no `classification` field

**Foundation skills** (cross-cutting, used across phases):
- No phase
- Directory: `foundation-{skill-name}`
- Frontmatter: `classification: foundation` (required), no `phase` field
- Use when: the skill applies to multiple phases equally

**Utility skills** (meta-skills, repo tooling):
- No phase
- Directory: `utility-{skill-name}`
- Frontmatter: `classification: utility` (required), no `phase` field
- Use when: the skill operates on the repo, workflow, or other skills

**Exemplar selection:**
Identify 1-2 existing skills that are the closest structural match:
- Same phase > same category > similar artifact type
- Read their SKILL.md to understand section structure, instruction style,
  output contract format, and quality checklist pattern
- Name the exemplars explicitly: "Modeled after [skill] — same phase,
  [category] category"

Present the classification and exemplar selection for user confirmation.

### Step 5: Generate Skill Implementation Packet

Produce the complete packet using `references/TEMPLATE.md` as the format.
The packet includes:

1. **Decision** — recommendation + Why Gate evidence (if applicable)
2. **Classification** — type, phase (if domain), category, directory name
3. **Overlap Analysis** — what was found, why this skill is still needed
4. **Quality Forecast** — K/P/C/W zone distribution + writing guidance:
   - Knowledge-heavy (≥35% K): reference frameworks, include When to Use
   - Process-heavy (≥35% P): numbered steps, prescriptive, clear I/O per step
   - Constraint-heavy (≥35% C): MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT rules, separate section
   - Wisdom-heavy (≥25% W): reflective questions, guide thinking
5. **Exemplar Skills** — which existing skills modeled, why
6. **Draft Frontmatter** — complete, valid YAML block
7. **Draft SKILL.md** — full content (not an outline), mirroring exemplar structure
8. **Draft TEMPLATE.md** — section headers with guidance comments
9. **Draft EXAMPLE.md** — complete, realistic example (150-300 lines) with a
   specific PM scenario, every section filled, optional sections demonstrated
   both filled and skipped
10. **Draft Command** — command frontmatter
11. **AGENTS.md Entry** — exact text to add
12. **Validation Checklist** — all CI rules checked against the draft
13. **Next Steps** — local CI, testing, contribution workflow

### Step 6: Write to Staging Area

Write all generated files to the staging area:

```
_staging/pm-skill-builder/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md               ← draft skill file
├── references/
│   ├── TEMPLATE.md        ← draft template
│   └── EXAMPLE.md         ← draft example
└── command.md             ← draft command
```

> **Note**: `_staging/` is gitignored — draft artifacts never ship in releases.
> The staging folder is discarded after promotion.

Report what was written and where.

### Step 7: Promote (on confirmation)

Ask: "Review the packet above. When ready, I'll promote the files to
their canonical locations. Proceed? [yes/no]"

If yes, promote by copying each file from staging to its canonical path:

| Staging file | Canonical location |
|--------------|--------------------|
| `_staging/pm-skill-builder/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` | `skills/{dir-name}/SKILL.md` |
| `_staging/pm-skill-builder/{skill-name}/references/TEMPLATE.md` | `skills/{dir-name}/references/TEMPLATE.md` |
| `_staging/pm-skill-builder/{skill-name}/references/EXAMPLE.md` | `skills/{dir-name}/references/EXAMPLE.md` |
| `_staging/pm-skill-builder/{skill-name}/command.md` | `commands/{command-name}.md` |

Where `{dir-name}` is the classification-prefixed directory (e.g., `deliver-change-communication`).

Then:
1. Create the target directory: `skills/{dir-name}/references/`
2. Copy each file to its canonical location
3. Append the AGENTS.md entry from the packet
4. Run CI validation: `bash scripts/lint-skills-frontmatter.sh && bash scripts/validate-agents-md.sh && bash scripts/validate-commands.sh`
5. If validation passes, delete the staging folder: `_staging/pm-skill-builder/{skill-name}/`
6. If validation fails, report the error and keep staging intact for fixes

Design rationale lives in the GitHub issue, PR, or effort brief — not
in a permanent packet file.

Provide post-promotion guidance:
- "Run CI locally: `bash scripts/lint-skills-frontmatter.sh`"
- "Test the skill: try `/{command-name}` with a realistic scenario"
- "If contributing: create a GitHub issue with the skill-proposal template,
  then open a PR"

    ## Decision

    **Recommendation**: Create new skill.

    A mid-stage SaaS company needs a repeatable way to produce change management
    communications when shipping features that alter user workflows. Existing skills
    cover adjacent concerns (release notes for external announcements, launch
    checklists for cross-functional readiness) but nothing guides the actual
    writing of internal adoption-focused communications that help users understand
    what changed, why it matters, and what they need to do differently.

    ---

    ## Classification

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | Type | domain |
    | Phase | deliver |
    | Category | coordination |
    | Directory | deliver-change-communication |
    | Command | /change-communication |

    ---

    ## Overlap Analysis

    ### Existing skills checked

    All 27 skills reviewed. Closest matches:

    - `deliver-release-notes` — produces external-facing release announcements
    - `deliver-launch-checklist` — tracks cross-functional launch readiness
    - `deliver-user-stories` — defines implementation requirements
    - `discover-stakeholder-summary` — maps stakeholder needs and influence

    ### Findings

    **deliver-release-notes**: Covers what shipped and why users should care, but
    targets external audiences (changelog readers, update-notification subscribers).
    Change communications target internal users, support teams, and account managers
    who need to understand workflow impact and guide adoption.

    **deliver-launch-checklist**: Includes "communications sent" as a line item but
    does not guide what those communications should contain, how to structure them
    for different audiences, or how to sequence rollout messaging.

    ### Why this skill is still needed

    No existing skill produces the actual communication artifact — the email, Slack
    message, or internal knowledge-base update that tells affected users what
    changed, what they need to do differently, and where to get help. This is a
    distinct coordination artifact in the Deliver phase.

    ## Quality Forecast

    ### Zone Distribution

    | Zone | Weight | Description |
    |------|--------|-------------|
    | Knowledge (K) | 20 | Change management principles, communication best practices |
    | Process (P) | 40 | Step-by-step workflow from feature context to drafted communications |
    | Constraint (C) | 15 | Audience segmentation rules, required sections, tone guidelines |
    | Wisdom (W) | 25 | Judgment on what level of detail each audience needs, when to escalate |

    **Dominant zone**: Process (40%)

    ### Writing Guidance

    Process-heavy skill: use numbered steps with clear inputs and outputs at each
    stage. Be prescriptive about the workflow order (identify audiences → assess
    impact → draft per-audience messages → review). Include decision points where
    the PM must choose between communication approaches based on change severity.

    ---

    ## Exemplar Skills

    | Skill | Why selected |
    |-------|-------------|
    | deliver-release-notes | Same phase (deliver), same category (coordination), closest artifact type — both produce written communications about product changes |
    | deliver-launch-checklist | Same phase (deliver), different category — shows how to structure a multi-audience coordination artifact with checkpoints |

    # Change Communication

    Change communication bridges the gap between shipping a feature and ensuring
    affected users successfully adopt the new workflow.

    ## When to Use

    - When a feature launch changes existing user workflows
    - When multiple audience segments need different levels of detail
    - When support teams need advance preparation for user questions

    ## Instructions

    ### Step 1: Identify the Change and Affected Audiences
    Gather the feature context and segment audiences by impact level.

    ### Step 2: Assess Workflow Impact
    Map before/after workflows for each audience segment.

    ### Step 3: Draft Per-Audience Messages
    Write targeted communications using the template structure.

    ### Step 4: Plan Rollout Sequence
    Determine timing and channels for each audience segment.

    ### Step 5: Review and Finalize
    Verify completeness, tone, and accuracy with stakeholders.

    ## Output Contract

    Use `references/TEMPLATE.md` to structure the output.

    ## Quality Checklist

    - [ ] All affected audience segments are identified
    - [ ] Before/after workflow changes are explicit
    - [ ] Each message includes what changed, why, and what to do next
    - [ ] Support enablement section is complete
    - [ ] Rollout timing accounts for audience dependencies

    ## Examples

    See `references/EXAMPLE.md` for a completed example.

    > Describe the feature change in 2-3 sentences. Focus on what users will
    > experience differently, not technical implementation details.

    ## Affected Audiences

    > List each audience segment with their relationship to the change.

    | Audience | Impact Level | Primary Channel |

    ## Support Enablement

    > What does the support team need to know to handle questions?

    ## Rollout Schedule

    > When does each communication go out, relative to the launch?

    | Audience | Timing | Channel | Owner |

    ## Draft EXAMPLE.md

    A complete example would demonstrate a change communication package for a
    realistic SaaS scenario — such as migrating a dashboard reporting interface
    from a legacy layout to a new design system. It would fill every template
    section with concrete content: three audience segments (power users, casual
    viewers, account administrators), before/after workflow descriptions, drafted
    messages per audience, a support FAQ, and a rollout timeline spanning T-5
    through T+3 days. Target length: 150-300 lines.
