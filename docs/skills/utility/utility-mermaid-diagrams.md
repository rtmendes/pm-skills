# Mermaid Diagrams

Create effective, syntactically valid mermaid diagrams for product documents.

## When to Use

- Creating mermaid diagrams for PRDs, specs, roadmaps, or stakeholder presentations
- Choosing which of 15 diagram types fits a specific communication need
- Debugging mermaid code that won't render or renders incorrectly
- Reviewing diagrams for clarity, accuracy, and accessibility

## When NOT to Use

- Exporting diagrams to image files (PNG/SVG) . that's a rendering tool concern
- Using non-mermaid diagramming tools (Figma, Lucidchart, draw.io)
- Creating purely decorative visuals with no informational purpose

## How to Use

Use the `/mermaid-diagrams` slash command:

```
/mermaid-diagrams "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/utility-mermaid-diagrams/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

1. **Identify what you're communicating** . What relationship, flow, hierarchy, or proportion needs to be visible? Who is the audience?
2. **Apply the cardinal rule** . Confirm a diagram adds value over a list or table
3. **Select a diagram type** . Use the selection guide above, browse `references/pm-use-cases.md` by task, or browse `references/diagram-catalog.md` by type
4. **Plan the diagram** . Fill out the planning worksheet in `references/TEMPLATE.md`: purpose, audience, node inventory, type rationale
5. **Write the mermaid code** . Follow `references/syntax-guide.md` rules; start with the minimal syntax example from `references/diagram-catalog.md` and expand
6. **Validate** . Run through the quality checklist below
7. **Embed** . Place the validated mermaid code block in your document

## Output Template

# Mermaid Diagram Planning Worksheet

<!-- Fill out this worksheet before writing mermaid code. It prevents wasted effort by ensuring you've chosen the right diagram type and inventoried your content. -->

## 1. Diagram Purpose

<!-- What relationship, flow, hierarchy, or proportion are you communicating? Who is the audience? -->

**What I'm showing:**
**Audience:**
**Where this will appear:** <!-- e.g., PRD, roadmap deck, technical spec, wiki page -->

## 2. Cardinal Rule Check

<!-- Does this need a diagram, or would a list/table communicate it better? -->

- [ ] This shows branching, relationships, or flow that a list would flatten
- [ ] A numbered list or table would NOT communicate this more clearly

If both boxes are not checked, use a list or table instead.

## 3. Diagram Type Selection

<!-- Use the selection guide in SKILL.md or browse diagram-catalog.md to pick the right type. -->

**Selected type:**
**Why this type:** <!-- What does this type show that others don't? -->
**Considered alternatives:** <!-- Which other types did you evaluate? -->

## 4. Node Inventory

<!-- List every entity, participant, state, or data point before writing code. This prevents mid-diagram discovery of missing nodes. -->

| Node/Entity | Role/Label | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| | | |

**Total node count:** ___ (check against type limit in diagram-catalog.md)

## 5. Draft Mermaid Code

```mermaid
%% MEANING: [Why this diagram exists]
%% Type: [selected type]
%% Direction: [TD/LR/BT/RL if applicable]
```

## 6. Validation Checklist

- [ ] Renders without error (tested in mermaid.live or target environment)
- [ ] Cardinal rule satisfied -- a list or table would not communicate this more clearly
- [ ] Not a linear sequence -- has branching, relationships, or hierarchy
- [ ] Labels with spaces/special characters are quoted
- [ ] Special characters escaped where needed
- [ ] Node count within type limit
- [ ] Colors are accessible (WCAG AA 3:1 contrast, black text on light backgrounds)
- [ ] Color is never the sole differentiator -- shapes and labels also distinguish elements
- [ ] Has descriptive title or surrounding context
- [ ] `%%` comments document any non-obvious layout or grouping choices

## Example Output

??? example "Worked Example: Diagrams for Pulse Analytics v2.0 Launch"
    # Worked Example: Diagrams for Pulse Analytics v2.0 Launch

    This example walks through four diagrams a PM would create while preparing Pulse Analytics v2.0 for launch. Each diagram follows the planning worksheet from `TEMPLATE.md` before writing any mermaid code.

    ---

    ## Example 1: Flowchart -- Feature Approval Workflow

    **Context:** The PRD needs a visual showing how new feature requests move through the approval process. Stakeholders keep asking "what happens after I submit a request?" and a text description has not stuck.

    ### Filled Worksheet

    **What I'm showing:** The decision path a feature request follows from submission to approval, deferral, or rejection.
    **Audience:** Engineering leads and business stakeholders reading the PRD.
    **Where this will appear:** Pulse Analytics v2.0 PRD, "Process" section.

    **Cardinal Rule Check:**
    - [x] This shows branching, relationships, or flow that a list would flatten
    - [x] A numbered list or table would NOT communicate this more clearly

    There are two decision points (strategic fit, feasibility) and a retry loop (spike). A list would hide the branching.

    **Selected type:** Flowchart
    **Why this type:** Multiple decision diamonds with branching outcomes -- flowcharts are built for this.
    **Considered alternatives:** State diagram (possible, but the focus is on the process, not lifecycle states).

    **Node Inventory:**

    | Node/Entity | Role/Label | Notes |
    |-------------|-----------|-------|
    | request | New Feature Request | Entry point |
    | strategic | Strategic Fit? | Decision diamond |
    | feasibility | Engineering Feasibility? | Decision diamond |
    | scoring | Priority Scoring | Process step |
    | approved | Approved | Terminal -- goes to backlog |
    | deferred | Deferred | Terminal |
    | spike | Spike Scheduled | Loops back to feasibility |
    | rejected | Rejected with Rationale | Terminal |

    **Total node count:** 8 (within flowchart limit of 12)

    ### Resulting Diagram

    ```mermaid
    %% MEANING: Feature approval workflow for Pulse Analytics v2.0 PRD
    flowchart TD
        request["New Feature Request"]
        strategic{"Strategic Fit?"}
        feasibility{"Engineering Feasibility?"}
        scoring["Priority Scoring"]
        approved["Approved"]
        deferred["Deferred"]
        spike["Spike Scheduled"]
        rejected["Rejected with Rationale"]

        request --> strategic
        strategic -- "Yes" --> feasibility
        strategic -- "No" --> rejected

        subgraph review ["Review Phase"]
            feasibility -- "Feasible" --> scoring
            feasibility -- "Needs Spike" --> spike
            spike -- "Re-evaluate" --> feasibility
        end

        feasibility -- "Not Feasible" --> rejected
        scoring -- "High Priority" --> approved
        scoring -- "Low Priority" --> deferred
    ```

    **What this communicates:** The diagram reveals that feature approval is not a straight line -- it has two independent gates (strategic and technical) and a retry loop for spikes. Stakeholders can immediately see that "needs spike" is not a rejection, it feeds back into the process. This branching structure would collapse into ambiguity in a numbered list.

    ## Example 2: Gantt -- Launch Timeline

    **Context:** The roadmap presentation needs a timeline showing the 8-week path to GA release, with dependencies visible so leadership can see which delays would cascade.

    ### Filled Worksheet

    **What I'm showing:** The 8-week launch timeline for Pulse Analytics v2.0 with task dependencies and critical path.
    **Audience:** Leadership team and cross-functional partners in the roadmap review.
    **Where this will appear:** Roadmap deck, "Timeline" slide.

    **Cardinal Rule Check:**
    - [x] This shows branching, relationships, or flow that a list would flatten
    - [x] A numbered list or table would NOT communicate this more clearly

    Parallel tracks (dev, QA, launch) with dependencies between them -- a list cannot show which tasks block others.

    **Selected type:** Gantt
    **Why this type:** Time-based schedule with parallel tracks and dependencies. Gantt charts are purpose-built for this.
    **Considered alternatives:** Timeline (good for milestones, but does not show task duration or dependencies).

    **Node Inventory:**

    | Node/Entity | Role/Label | Notes |
    |-------------|-----------|-------|
    | backend | Backend API | 3 weeks |
    | frontend | Frontend Dashboard | 4 weeks, starts week 2 |
    | pipeline | Data Pipeline | 2 weeks |
    | integration | Integration Testing | 1 week, after backend + frontend |
    | uat | UAT | 1 week, after integration testing |
    | perf | Performance Testing | 3 days, parallel to UAT |
    | docs | Documentation | 1 week |
    | marketing | Marketing Prep | 1 week |
    | ga | GA Release | Milestone |

    **Total node count:** 9 tasks (within Gantt limit of 20)

    ### Resulting Diagram

    ```mermaid
    %% MEANING: Pulse Analytics v2.0 launch timeline with dependencies
    gantt
        title Pulse Analytics v2.0 Launch Timeline
        dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
        axisFormat %b %d

        section Development
        Backend API           :crit, backend, 2026-05-04, 3w
        Frontend Dashboard    :crit, frontend, 2026-05-11, 4w
        Data Pipeline         :pipeline, 2026-05-04, 2w

        section Quality
        Integration Testing   :crit, integration, after frontend, 1w
        UAT                   :crit, uat, after integration, 1w
        Performance Testing   :perf, after integration, 3d

        section Launch
        Documentation         :docs, after uat, 1w
        Marketing Prep        :marketing, after uat, 1w
        GA Release            :milestone, ga, after docs, 0d
    ```

    **What this communicates:** The Gantt chart exposes the critical path: Backend API must finish before Integration Testing can start, and any delay in that chain pushes GA. It also shows that Data Pipeline and Performance Testing are off the critical path -- they have slack. A bullet list of tasks with dates would hide these dependency relationships entirely.

    ---

    ## Example 3: Sequence -- Webhook Integration Flow

    **Context:** The technical spec needs to show how webhook delivery works across five services, including the async handoff and retry behavior. Engineers reviewing the spec need to see the exact message flow.

    ### Filled Worksheet

    **What I'm showing:** The multi-service interaction flow for webhook event delivery, including async processing and retry logic.
    **Audience:** Backend engineers and integration partners reading the technical spec.
    **Where this will appear:** Pulse Analytics v2.0 Technical Spec, "Webhook Architecture" section.

    **Cardinal Rule Check:**
    - [x] This shows branching, relationships, or flow that a list would flatten
    - [x] A numbered list or table would NOT communicate this more clearly

    Five participants exchanging messages with async boundaries, a retry loop, and conditional behavior (success vs. failure). This is inherently a multi-party interaction.

    **Selected type:** Sequence
    **Why this type:** Multi-party message exchange with async boundaries and conditional flows -- sequence diagrams show this precisely.
    **Considered alternatives:** Flowchart (would work for the overall flow, but loses the participant swimlanes that make service responsibilities clear).

    **Node Inventory:**

    | Node/Entity | Role/Label | Notes |
    |-------------|-----------|-------|
    | CustomerApp | Customer App | External caller |
    | PulseAPI | Pulse API | Entry point, sync response |
    | EventProcessor | Event Processor | Async processing |
    | WebhookService | Webhook Service | Delivery + retry |
    | CustomerEndpoint | Customer Endpoint | External receiver |

    **Total node count:** 5 participants (within sequence limit of 6)

    ### Resulting Diagram

    ```mermaid
    %% MEANING: Webhook delivery flow showing async handoff and retry logic
    sequenceDiagram
        participant CustomerApp as Customer App
        participant PulseAPI as Pulse API
        participant EventProcessor as Event Processor
        participant WebhookService as Webhook Service
        participant CustomerEndpoint as Customer Endpoint

        CustomerApp->>PulseAPI: Send Event
        PulseAPI->>PulseAPI: Validate Payload
        PulseAPI-->>CustomerApp: 202 Accepted

        PulseAPI-)EventProcessor: Queue Event (async)
        EventProcessor->>EventProcessor: Process + Enrich
        EventProcessor-)WebhookService: Dispatch Webhook

        loop Retry (max 3 attempts)
            WebhookService->>CustomerEndpoint: POST webhook payload
            alt Success
                CustomerEndpoint-->>WebhookService: 200 OK
                WebhookService->>WebhookService: Mark Delivered
            else Delivery Failure
                CustomerEndpoint-->>WebhookService: 5xx / Timeout
                WebhookService->>WebhookService: Backoff + Retry
            end
        end
    ```

    **What this communicates:** The sequence diagram makes three things visible that prose obscures. First, the sync/async boundary: the customer gets 202 immediately while processing happens in the background. Second, the retry loop with backoff is a distinct phase, not buried in a paragraph. Third, the alt block shows that success and failure are handled differently at the same interaction point. Engineers can trace the exact message flow between services without reading paragraphs of text.

    ## Example 4: Quadrant -- Feature Prioritization

    **Context:** The planning meeting needs a visual to drive prioritization discussion. Eight candidate features need to be evaluated on two dimensions: engineering effort and user impact.

    ### Filled Worksheet

    **What I'm showing:** Relative positioning of 8 candidate features on effort vs. impact dimensions to guide prioritization.
    **Audience:** Product and engineering leads in the quarterly planning meeting.
    **Where this will appear:** Planning meeting deck, "Prioritization" slide.

    **Cardinal Rule Check:**
    - [x] This shows branching, relationships, or flow that a list would flatten
    - [x] A numbered list or table would NOT communicate this more clearly

    Two-dimensional positioning reveals clusters and outliers that a sorted list on a single dimension would miss. Features in the "quick wins" quadrant are only visible when both dimensions are plotted.

    **Selected type:** Quadrant
    **Why this type:** Two-axis comparison with labeled quadrants -- purpose-built for 2D prioritization.
    **Considered alternatives:** None -- no other mermaid type handles 2D scatter positioning.

    **Node Inventory:**

    | Node/Entity | Role/Label | Notes |
    |-------------|-----------|-------|
    | Dashboard Export | Quick Win | Low effort, high impact |
    | Custom Alerts | Strategic Bet | High effort, high impact |
    | Dark Mode | Low Priority | Low effort, low impact |
    | API Rate Limits | Near boundary | Medium effort, medium impact |
    | SSO Integration | Strategic Bet | High effort, high impact |
    | Bulk Import | Quick Win | Low effort, high impact |
    | Audit Log | Near boundary | Medium effort, medium impact |
    | Mobile App | Strategic Bet | Very high effort, very high impact |

    **Total node count:** 8 data points (within quadrant limit of 10-12)

    ### Resulting Diagram

    ```mermaid
    %% MEANING: Feature prioritization for Pulse Analytics v2.0 planning meeting
    quadrantChart
        title Feature Prioritization Matrix
        x-axis "Low Effort" --> "High Effort"
        y-axis "Low Impact" --> "High Impact"
        quadrant-1 "Strategic Bets"
        quadrant-2 "Quick Wins"
        quadrant-3 "Low Priority"
        quadrant-4 "Reconsider"
        "Dashboard Export": [0.2, 0.8]
        "Custom Alerts": [0.7, 0.85]
        "Dark Mode": [0.3, 0.4]
        "API Rate Limits": [0.5, 0.6]
        "SSO Integration": [0.8, 0.7]
        "Bulk Import": [0.15, 0.65]
        "Audit Log": [0.6, 0.5]
        "Mobile App": [0.9, 0.9]
    ```

    **What this communicates:** The quadrant chart instantly reveals that Dashboard Export and Bulk Import are quick wins -- high impact, low effort -- while Mobile App demands the most investment for the highest payoff. The spatial clustering makes trade-offs visible: API Rate Limits and Audit Log sit near the center, suggesting they need further analysis before committing. A ranked list sorted by impact alone would hide the effort dimension that makes prioritization actionable.

    ## Key Takeaways

    - **The worksheet prevents false starts.** Inventorying nodes before writing code catches missing participants, states, or data points early -- not mid-diagram when restructuring is expensive.
    - **The cardinal rule check saved work.** If any of these examples had been a simple linear sequence, the worksheet would have redirected to a list before any mermaid code was written.
    - **Diagram type selection is a design decision.** Each example considered alternatives and chose the type that best matched the communication need, not the one the PM was most familiar with.
    - **Context around the diagram matters.** The mermaid code block alone is not enough -- the "What this communicates" framing helps the audience know what to look for in the diagram.

## Real-World Examples

See this skill applied to three different product contexts:

??? example "Storevine (B2B): Storevine B2B ecommerce platform . mermaid flowchart for Campaigns email send approval workflow"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /mermaid-diagrams

    I need a flowchart showing the Campaigns email send approval workflow. When a merchant clicks "Schedule Send," the campaign goes through content validation, compliance checks (CAN-SPAM), optional manager approval (for merchants on the Enterprise plan), and then queues for send. If any check fails, the merchant gets sent back to the editor with specific errors. I want to show this in the Campaigns PRD.
    ```
