# Solution Brief

A solution brief is a concise, one-page document that communicates the proposed solution to a problem. It serves as the bridge between problem understanding and detailed specification, providing enough context for stakeholders to align on the approach without getting lost in implementation details. The one-page constraint forces clarity and prioritization.

## When to Use

- Pitching a solution approach to stakeholders for buy-in
- Aligning cross-functional teams on what you're building and why
- Documenting solution intent before detailed PRD writing
- Comparing multiple solution options at a high level
- Communicating product direction to leadership

## How to Use

Use the `/solution-brief` slash command:

```
/solution-brief "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/develop-solution-brief/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to create a solution brief, follow these steps:

1. **Recap the Problem**
   Summarize the problem in 2-3 sentences maximum. Don't re-explain the full problem statement — reference it if needed. The reader should immediately understand what pain point this solution addresses.

2. **Describe the Proposed Solution**
   Explain what you're building in clear, non-technical language. Focus on the user experience and core value proposition. Avoid implementation details — this is about *what*, not *how*.

3. **List Key Features**
   Identify 3-5 essential features that comprise the solution. These should be the minimum set needed to solve the problem. Resist the urge to include nice-to-haves — the one-page constraint demands focus.

4. **Define Success Metrics**
   Connect the solution to measurable outcomes. How will you know if this works? Reference metrics from the problem statement and set targets.

5. **Acknowledge Trade-offs**
   Document what you're explicitly NOT doing and why. Good solution briefs are honest about scope limitations and alternatives that were considered but rejected.

6. **Identify Risks and Mitigations**
   Surface the biggest risks to success and your plan to address them. This builds stakeholder confidence and surfaces concerns early.

7. **Outline Next Steps**
   Provide 3-5 immediate actions to move the solution forward. Be specific about who does what.

## Example Output

??? example "Solution Brief: Streamlined Mobile Checkout"
    # Solution Brief: Streamlined Mobile Checkout

    ## Problem Recap

    Mobile shoppers abandon checkout at a 73% rate, significantly higher than desktop's 45%. Users cite confusing multi-step flows, small form fields, and unexpected shipping costs as primary frustrations. This represents a $177M annual revenue opportunity.

    ## Proposed Solution

    We will redesign mobile checkout as a single-page experience with progressive disclosure. Instead of navigating through multiple screens, shoppers will complete their purchase on one streamlined page that expands sections as needed. The design prioritizes large touch targets, saved payment methods, and upfront shipping transparency.

    ## Key Features

    1. **Single-Page Checkout:** All checkout steps visible on one page with accordion sections that expand/collapse. Users always see their progress and can edit any section without losing data.

    2. **Express Payment Options:** Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal one-tap buttons prominently displayed at top. Returning customers can checkout in under 30 seconds.

    3. **Upfront Shipping Calculator:** Shipping costs displayed based on cart contents before checkout begins. No surprise costs at the final step.

    4. **Smart Form Fields:** Large, mobile-optimized input fields with auto-formatting (phone, credit card). Address autocomplete via Google Places API reduces typing by 70%.

    5. **Guest Checkout Persistence:** Cart and partially-entered information saved for 7 days, allowing users to return and complete purchase without starting over.

    ## Success Metrics

    | Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
    |--------|---------|--------|----------|
    | Mobile checkout abandonment | 73% | 60% | Q1 2026 |
    | Mobile checkout completion time | 4.2 min | 2.0 min | Q1 2026 |
    | Express payment adoption | 0% | 25% | Q2 2026 |

    ## Trade-offs Considered

    | What We're Not Doing | Why |
    |---------------------|-----|
    | Removing guest checkout | Legal requirement in EU markets; also helps first-time buyers |
    | Cross-sell/upsell in checkout | User research shows this adds friction; moving to cart instead |
    | Custom payment form design | Payment provider contract limits changes until March |
    | Cryptocurrency payment | Low demand (<1% of requests); complexity not justified |

    ## Risks & Mitigations

    | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
    |------|------------|--------|------------|
    | Apple Pay integration delays | Medium | High | Parallel-path with card-only fallback; engage Apple early |
    | Page load performance on single-page | Medium | Medium | Lazy-load sections; aggressive image optimization |
    | User confusion with accordion UX | Low | Medium | A/B test against step-based alternative; quick iteration |

    ## Next Steps

    2. Scope technical requirements with engineering — PM + Tech Lead, Jan 22
    3. Begin Apple Pay sandbox integration — iOS Engineer, Jan 25

## Real-World Examples

See this skill applied to three different product contexts:

??? example "Storevine (B2B): Storevine B2B ecommerce platform — Campaigns one-page solution brief for head of product review"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /solution-brief

    Project: Campaigns — native email marketing for Storevine merchants

    I need a one-page brief for a head of product review before engineering
    kickoff. Full PRD already written and reviewed with engineering lead.
    This brief is for executive context, not the build team.

    Problem (3 sentences max):
    - 68% of active merchants use external email tools [fictional]
    - Built-in tools lack segmentation + attribution
    - 22% churn cited email gaps as a top-3 reason [fictional]

    Solution: native email within Storevine admin — no separate tool
    subscription, no sync required

    v1 features to include:
    - Purchase-based audience segments (pre-built, seeded from Storevine data)
    - Guided first-campaign flow (product-seeded templates)
    - Revenue attribution (SendGrid webhook → order database)
    - CAN-SPAM/GDPR compliance built in
    - Abandoned cart automation

    Success metrics, trade-offs (what we're NOT building), and top risks.
    ```

    # Solution Brief: Campaigns — Native Email Marketing for Storevine Merchants

??? example "Brainshelf (Consumer): Brainshelf consumer PKM app — Resurface feature solution brief for team alignment"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /solution-brief

    resurface one-pager for the team. need to get everyone on the same
    page before sprint 8 starts. marco wants to see it too.

    the solution: daily morning email digest that surfaces 3-5 saved items
    matched to what the user has been reading recently. opt-in required.
    7:30 AM local time. topic matching algorithm picks the items.

    key features: email digest, topic matching, opt-in flow, one-click
    read, cadence setting (daily default, can switch to 3x/week).

    primary metric: 7-day return rate, 18% → 25% [fictional].
    secondary: email CTR. guardrail: unsub rate ≤2%/week.

    explicitly NOT doing: in-app resurfacing (deferred), push notifications
    (too aggressive for first version), smart collections (too big),
    annotation-based resurfacing (that's readwise's approach, we're
    doing topic matching instead).
    ```

    **Output:**

    # Solution Brief: Resurface — Morning Email Digest

??? example "Workbench (Enterprise): Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: Blueprints solution brief (one-pager)"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /solution-brief

    Product: Workbench Blueprints -- reusable document templates with required sections and role-based approval gates
    Stage: Pre-PRD; consolidating decisions from discovery, define, and develop phases into a one-pager

    Problem recap:
    - 38% of enterprise documents reach approval with >=1 empty required section [fictional]
    - Median time to first approval: 4.0 days [fictional]; most of that is rejection-revision cycles
    - 60% of enterprise projects lack an approved kickoff doc at handoff [fictional]
    - No doc-first competitor enforces template section completion

    Proposed solution:
    - Blueprint templates with required and optional sections, designated by template admins
    - Required-section enforcement at submission (Submit button disabled until all required sections complete)
    - Native role-based approval gates (single-stage approval in v1; multi-stage in v1.1)
    - Real-time co-editing via Yjs CRDTs (offline-first, 20+ concurrent editors [fictional])
    - Hybrid creation flow: guided wizard for first-time authors, blank canvas for returning authors
    - SAML SSO, audit logs, and SCIM provisioning for enterprise deployment

    Key features (5):
    1. Required-section enforcement
    2. Native approval gates
    3. Yjs-powered co-editing
    4. Hybrid wizard/canvas creation flow
    5. Enterprise security (SAML, audit logs, SCIM)

    Success metrics:
    - Median time to first approval: 4.0 days -> <=2.5 days [fictional]
    - Approval rejection rate: 38% -> <=15% [fictional]
    - Enterprise accounts with active Blueprints: 200 of 500 within 6 months of GA [fictional]
    - Enterprise churn (compliance segment): 18% -> <=12% within 12 months [fictional]

    Trade-offs: No AI-assisted drafting in v1 (Partial per competitive analysis); no multi-stage approval in v1; no Confluence template import in v1 (guided manual migration only)

    Risks: CRDT complexity (mitigated by spike); author abandonment from enforcement (mitigated by A/B test); Atlassian Rovo response (monitor)

    Stakeholders: Sandra C. (Head of Product), Derek H. (Head of Marketing), Mei-Lin T. (Enterprise Sales Lead)
    ```
