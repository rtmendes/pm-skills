# Design Rationale

A design rationale document captures the "why" behind design decisions.the context, constraints, alternatives considered, and reasoning that led to a particular solution. While designs themselves show what was built, rationale documents preserve institutional knowledge about why it was built that way.

## When to Use

- When making significant UX decisions that affect user experience
- Before design reviews to prepare stakeholder discussions
- When multiple valid approaches exist and the choice needs justification
- To onboard new team members to existing design decisions
- When revisiting past decisions to understand original reasoning
- During design system evolution to document pattern choices

## How to Use

Use the `/design-rationale` slash command:

```
/design-rationale "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/develop-design-rationale/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to document design rationale, follow these steps:

1. **State the Decision**
   Begin with a clear, one-sentence summary of what design decision was made. This becomes the title and reference point for the document.

2. **Describe the Context**
   Explain the situation that prompted this decision. What problem were you solving? What constraints existed? What user needs informed the direction? Include relevant research findings.

3. **List Options Considered**
   Document at least 2-3 alternatives that were evaluated. For each option, describe what it would look like and its key characteristics. Be fair to all options.avoid strawmen.

4. **Define Evaluation Criteria**
   Specify how options were assessed: usability heuristics, technical feasibility, brand alignment, user research findings, business requirements, or design principles.

5. **Explain the Reasoning**
   Walk through why the chosen option best meets the criteria. Be explicit about trade-offs.what you gained and what you sacrificed. Acknowledge where the decision is reversible vs. irreversible.

6. **Document Trade-offs Accepted**
   Every design decision involves trade-offs. Name what you gave up and why it was acceptable. This honesty helps future teams understand constraints.

7. **Note Follow-up Considerations**
   Capture anything that needs attention later: metrics to watch, conditions that might warrant revisiting the decision, or related decisions to make.

## Example Output

??? example "Design Rationale: Primary Navigation Pattern for Mobile App"
    # Design Rationale: Primary Navigation Pattern for Mobile App

    ## Decision Summary

    **Decision:** Use a bottom tab bar with 5 primary actions plus a "More" overflow menu for secondary features.
    **Date:** January 2026
    **Decision Makers:** Sarah (Design Lead), Marcus (PM), Chen (Engineering Lead)
    **Status:** Implemented

    ---

    ## Context

    ### Problem Statement

    Our mobile app has grown from 12 to 50+ features over three years. The current hamburger menu navigation has become a "junk drawer" where users struggle to find features. Task completion rates have dropped 15% in the past year, and support tickets about "where is X?" have increased 40%.

    ### User Need

    Users need to quickly access core functionality without hunting through menus. Research shows our users typically need the same 5-7 features in 80% of sessions, but they can't remember where those features live in the current navigation.

    ### Constraints

    | Constraint Type | Description |
    |-----------------|-------------|
    | Technical | Must work across iOS and Android without platform-specific implementations |
    | Business | Cannot remove any features; deprecation requires 6-month notice to enterprise clients |
    | Timeline | Must ship by end of Q1 to align with marketing campaign |
    | Resources | 2 engineers, 1 designer available for implementation |
    | Brand/Platform | Must follow both iOS HIG and Material Design enough to feel native on each |

    ### Design Principles Applied

    - **Progressive disclosure:** Surface what's needed, hide what's not until relevant
    - **Recognition over recall:** Users shouldn't have to remember where things are
    - **Flexibility and efficiency:** Support both novice wayfinding and expert shortcuts

    ---

    ## Options Considered

    ### Option A: Enhanced Hamburger Menu with Categories

    **Description:** Keep the hamburger menu but reorganize features into clear categories with icons. Add a "Favorites" section users can customize.

    **Pros:**
    - Minimal development effort.iterates on existing pattern
    - Preserves screen real estate for content
    - Familiar pattern for existing users
    - Scales to unlimited features

    **Cons:**
    - Hidden navigation still requires recall ("where's Settings?")
    - Extra tap to reach any feature
    - User research shows low engagement with customization features
    - Doesn't solve core discoverability problem

    ---

    ### Option B: Floating Action Button (FAB) with Radial Menu

    **Description:** A prominent FAB in the bottom-right that expands to show 6 primary actions in a radial/fan pattern. Secondary features remain in a hamburger menu.

    **Pros:**
    - Highly discoverable.the FAB draws attention
    - Quick access to primary actions (single tap to reveal)
    - Visually distinctive and modern
    - Works well for task-oriented apps

    **Cons:**
    - Radial menus have poor accessibility (hard to tap precisely)
    - Only practical for 6-8 items; doesn't solve secondary navigation
    - Covers content when expanded
    - Not a standard pattern on iOS (feels Android-native)

    ---

    ### Option C: Bottom Tab Bar with More Menu (Selected)

    **Description:** A persistent 5-item bottom tab bar showing the most-used features. The 5th tab is "More" which opens a organized list of all other features.

    **Pros:**
    - Most accessible pattern.large tap targets, always visible
    - Industry standard across both iOS and Android
    - Highly discoverable.users instantly see what app does
    - Research shows 5 items is optimal for quick scanning
    - "More" menu can be organized and searchable

    **Cons:**
    - Uses 50px of screen height permanently
    - Only 4 primary features get direct access
    - Requires difficult prioritization decisions
    - "More" menu can still become cluttered

    ## Evaluation

    ### Criteria

    | Criterion | Weight | Description |
    |-----------|--------|-------------|
    | Discoverability | High | How easily can users find features? |
    | Accessibility | High | Can users with motor or vision impairments use it? |
    | Task efficiency | High | How quickly can users complete common tasks? |
    | Scalability | Medium | Does it work as features grow? |
    | Implementation effort | Medium | How much engineering work? |
    | Platform consistency | Medium | Does it feel native on both iOS and Android? |

    ### Comparison Matrix

    | Criterion | Option A | Option B | Option C |
    |-----------|----------|----------|----------|
    | Discoverability | Poor | Good | Excellent |
    | Accessibility | Good | Poor | Excellent |
    | Task efficiency | Poor | Good | Excellent |
    | Scalability | Excellent | Poor | Good |
    | Implementation effort | Low | Medium | Medium |
    | Platform consistency | Good | Poor | Excellent |

    ### User Research Input

    - Usability testing (n=8): 7/8 users found target feature faster with bottom nav than hamburger
    - Analytics: Current top 5 features account for 78% of all feature usage
    - Competitive analysis: 4/5 top-rated productivity apps use bottom tab navigation
    - User quote: "I wish I didn't have to think about where things are. Just show me."

    ---

    ## Decision Rationale

    ### Why Option C?

    The bottom tab bar provides the best balance of discoverability, accessibility, and task efficiency.our three highest-weighted criteria. While it sacrifices some screen real estate and limits direct access to 4 features, user research strongly validates that our users primarily need quick access to a small set of features.

    The hamburger menu (Option A) fails to solve our core problem: users still have to remember where features are. The FAB approach (Option B) has significant accessibility concerns and would require iOS users to learn an Android-centric pattern.

    ### Key Differentiators

    1. **Visibility:** Tab bar is always visible, creating constant awareness of primary capabilities
    2. **Accessibility:** Large, persistent tap targets meet WCAG requirements without accommodation
    3. **Mental model:** Users immediately understand app structure upon opening
    4. **Cross-platform:** Pattern works identically on iOS and Android, reducing engineering complexity

    ### Dissenting Opinions

    Chen (Engineering) initially preferred Option A due to lower implementation effort. After reviewing the user research showing 15% task completion decline, he agreed that Option C's benefits justified the additional work.

    ---

    ## Trade-offs Accepted

    ### What We Gave Up

    | Trade-off | Impact | Why Acceptable |
    |-----------|--------|----------------|
    | Screen real estate | 50px permanently used by navigation | On modern devices, this is <5% of screen; content scrolls. User research showed no concern. |
    | Secondary feature access | Requires 2 taps for "More" features | 78% of usage is top 5 features; acceptable friction for long tail |
    | Feature count limitation | Can only highlight 4 features directly | Forces prioritization; actually a benefit for user clarity |

    ### Risks

    | Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
    |------|------------|------------|
    | Users can't find features in "More" | Medium | Add search within More menu; use clear categories |
    | Wrong 4 features selected | Medium | A/B test feature selection; make configurable per user role |
    | Enterprise pushback on change | Low | Provide documentation and training materials; grandfather existing muscle memory with shortcuts |

    ---

    ## Reversibility

    **Is this decision reversible?** Yes, with effort

    **Cost to reverse:** Significant.requires navigation rewrite and user re-education. Estimate 4-6 weeks engineering work plus user communication.

    **Conditions that would warrant reverting:**
    - Task completion rates don't improve after 3 months
    - User complaints about tab bar exceed hamburger complaints (with statistical significance)
    - A/B test shows no improvement in feature discoverability

    ---

    ## Follow-up Considerations

    ### Metrics to Monitor

    - **Task completion rate:** Should improve from 65% to 75%+ for core flows
    - **"Where is X?" support tickets:** Should decrease by 30%+
    - **Feature discovery:** Track % of users who use features in "More" menu
    - **Time to task completion:** Should decrease for top 5 features

    ### Future Decisions Required

    - Which 4 features get tab bar placement (separate decision document)
    - "More" menu organization and categories
    - Whether to add user customization of tab bar items
    - Tablet/iPad navigation pattern (larger screen may warrant different approach)

    ### Revisit Triggers

    - If app feature count exceeds 100 and "More" becomes unwieldy
    - If user research reveals significantly different feature usage patterns
    - If platform conventions change substantially

## Real-World Examples

See this skill applied to three different product contexts:

??? example "Storevine (B2B): Storevine B2B ecommerce platform . Campaigns audience selection UX design decision"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /design-rationale

    Project: Campaigns . native email marketing for Storevine merchants
    Decision: Audience selection UX for the campaign creation flow
    Stage: Pre-sprint design review . finalizing Figma specs before engineering

    Decision I need to document:
    - We debated 3 audience selection approaches before the design review:
      A. Custom filter builder (SQL-like nested conditions, matches Klaviyo)
      B. Pre-built named segments only (curated list, no customization)
      C. Pre-built segments as default + custom filter as secondary option
    - We chose Option C after design review with PM, design lead, and eng lead

    Context:
    - Primary target segment: non-adopter merchants (no current email tool)
    - Interview data: 3 of 8 merchants cited setup complexity as the barrier
    - Figma link: [internal . Campaigns audience selection v3 spec]

    Need: full design rationale document for the engineering handoff package.
    Decision makers: Design Lead, Growth PM, Engineering Lead.
    ```

    # Design Rationale: Campaigns Audience Selection UX

??? example "Brainshelf (Consumer): Brainshelf consumer PKM app . digest email layout design decision for the Resurface feature"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /design-rationale

    digest email layout for resurface. dan showed three options:

    option A: rich cards . article thumbnail, title, excerpt, topic tag
    for each item. looks great in figma but heavy on images and might
    trigger promotions tab.

    option B: structured text . article title (linked), source domain,
    topic tag, estimated read time. no images. clean, editorial feel.
    fast to scan.

    option C: minimal plain text . just titles and links, no styling.
    maximum deliverability but looks like a system notification, not a
    product experience.

    we did a quick preference test with 12 users. 9 preferred option B.
    reasons: "fast," "doesn't look like spam," "I'd actually read this."

    going with B. need the rationale written up.
    ```

    **Output:**

    # Design Rationale: Resurface Digest Email Layout

??? example "Workbench (Enterprise): Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: guided wizard vs. blank canvas for Blueprint creation flow"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /design-rationale

    Decision: Blueprint creation flow -- guided wizard vs. blank canvas
    Product: Workbench Blueprints (enterprise doc templates with required sections and approval gates)
    Stage: Develop phase, pre-PRD

    Problem: How should a new Blueprint be created? Two options:
    - Option A: Guided wizard -- step-by-step flow, one section per screen, progress indicator, validation per step
    - Option B: Blank canvas -- full template opens in the editor, all sections visible, fill in any order (Confluence model)
    - Option C (hybrid): Wizard for first-time creation, canvas for returning authors who have completed a Blueprint before

    Context:
    - Enterprise users are not power users of Workbench yet -- Blueprints is a new feature
    - Required sections are the core differentiator; the creation flow must make enforcement feel helpful, not punitive
    - Discovery interviews: middle managers act as "docs police"; the creation flow should reduce, not increase, that burden
    - Closed-beta preference test (8 users [fictional]): 6 preferred wizard on first use, 5 preferred canvas after their second Blueprint
    - Karen L. (Eng Lead): wizard adds 1 sprint of effort vs. canvas [fictional]
    - Tomas G. (Design Lead): wizard produces cleaner first submissions but risks feeling patronizing for experienced authors

    Evaluation criteria: first-submission completeness rate, author time-to-submit, author satisfaction (NPS), engineering effort, scalability to custom templates

    Stakeholders: Sandra C. (Head of Product), Karen L. (Eng Lead), Tomas G. (Design Lead)
    ```
