# Spike Summary

A spike summary documents the results of a time-boxed exploration . a focused investigation to reduce uncertainty before committing to implementation. Spikes answer specific questions like "Can we integrate with this API?" or "Is this technology viable for our use case?" The summary captures findings so the team can make informed decisions without the spike participants needing to repeat explanations.

## When to Use

- After completing a time-boxed technical exploration
- When evaluating technology choices or vendor options
- After proof-of-concept work that needs to inform team decisions
- When investigating feasibility of a proposed solution
- Before committing engineering resources to a new approach

## How to Use

Use the `/spike-summary` slash command:

```
/spike-summary "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/develop-spike-summary/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to document a spike, follow these steps:

1. **State the Question Clearly**
   Articulate the specific question the spike was designed to answer. Good spike questions are focused and answerable with the time-box available. If the question evolved during the spike, document both the original and final versions.

2. **Define the Time-Box**
   Document the time allocated (e.g., 3 days) and actual time spent. If the spike exceeded its time-box, explain why and note any remaining work.

3. **Describe the Approach**
   Explain what was tried, in what order, and why. This helps future readers understand the methodology and whether alternative approaches were considered.

4. **Present Findings with Evidence**
   Document what was learned, supported by concrete evidence . code samples, performance benchmarks, screenshots, or API responses. Distinguish between verified findings and hypotheses that need more testing.

5. **Make a Clear Recommendation**
   Answer the original question directly: proceed, do not proceed, or proceed with conditions. Avoid hedging . the team needs actionable guidance.

6. **Document Artifacts**
   Link to any code, prototypes, diagrams, or documentation created during the spike. These artifacts often have ongoing value beyond the summary.

7. **Capture Open Questions**
   Note what the spike didn't answer and what additional investigation might be needed.

??? example "Spike Summary: Payment Processor Evaluation"
    # Spike Summary: Payment Processor Evaluation

    ## Overview

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | **Question to Answer** | Should we use Stripe or Adyen for payment processing on our new platform? |
    | **Time-Box** | 3 days |
    | **Actual Time Spent** | 2.5 days |
    | **Spike Lead** | Chen Wei, Senior Backend Engineer |
    | **Date Completed** | 2026-01-12 |

    ## Background

    Our new e-commerce platform needs payment processing capabilities. We currently process $2M/month through a legacy system and expect to scale to $10M/month within 18 months. The decision between Stripe and Adyen will affect our transaction costs, integration timeline, and ability to expand internationally.

    ## Approach

    ### What We Tried

    1. **Stripe Sandbox Integration:** Built a complete checkout flow using Stripe Elements. Created test webhooks and simulated various payment scenarios including 3D Secure, declined cards, and refunds.

    2. **Adyen Test Integration:** Implemented Adyen's Drop-in Components in a parallel branch. Tested the same scenarios as Stripe for direct comparison.

    3. **Fee Analysis:** Modeled transaction costs at current volume ($2M/month) and projected volume ($10M/month) using published pricing and obtained quotes from both vendors.

    4. **International Capability Review:** Researched multi-currency support, local payment methods, and regulatory compliance for our target markets (US, EU, UK, Canada).

    ### Technologies/Tools Evaluated

    - Stripe API v2024-12-18, Stripe Elements, Stripe Webhooks
    - Adyen API v68, Drop-in Components, Adyen Webhooks
    - Both tested with React 18 frontend, Node.js 20 backend

    ## Findings

    ### Finding 1: Stripe has significantly better developer experience

    Stripe's documentation is more comprehensive and includes more working examples. The sandbox environment required no setup . we were processing test payments within 15 minutes. Adyen required account manager approval and took 2 days to get sandbox access.

    **Evidence:**
    - Time to first successful test payment: Stripe (15 min), Adyen (2 days including access wait)
    - Documentation score (internal rating): Stripe 9/10, Adyen 6/10
    - Stack Overflow questions with accepted answers: Stripe (47,000+), Adyen (3,200)

    ### Finding 2: Adyen has lower fees at scale

    At our projected $10M/month volume, Adyen's interchange++ pricing results in meaningful savings. However, at current volume, the difference is marginal.

    **Evidence:**
    - Current volume ($2M/month): Stripe $58K/year, Adyen $54K/year (7% savings)
    - Projected volume ($10M/month): Stripe $290K/year, Adyen $245K/year (16% savings)
    - Stripe's 2.9% + $0.30 vs. Adyen's interchange++ (avg 2.4% + $0.20 at volume)

    ### Finding 3: Both meet international requirements, but Adyen has edge in Europe

    Both processors support our target markets. Adyen has more local payment method integrations in Europe (iDEAL, Bancontact, SEPA Direct Debit) which could improve conversion for EU customers.

    **Evidence:**
    - Local EU payment methods: Stripe (8), Adyen (15)
    - Both support Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal
    - Both are PCI Level 1 compliant

    ### Finding 4: Stripe's subscription billing is more mature

    If we add subscription products in the future, Stripe Billing is significantly more capable than Adyen's recurring payment features. Adyen would require a third-party subscription management tool.

    **Evidence:**
    - Stripe Billing: Proration, trial periods, usage-based billing, revenue recovery
    - Adyen: Basic recurring only, no built-in subscription management

    ## Recommendation

    **Decision:** Proceed with Stripe for MVP, plan migration path to Adyen

    ### Rationale

    Stripe is the right choice for our current stage. The superior developer experience will accelerate our launch timeline by approximately 2-3 weeks. At our current volume, fee differences are minimal ($4K/year). Once we reach $10M/month and validate product-market fit, we should reevaluate migration to Adyen for cost savings.

    ### If Proceeding

    - Use Stripe Elements for checkout (fastest integration)
    - Implement webhook handlers for payment lifecycle events
    - Estimated integration effort: 2 weeks for full production deployment
    - Build payment abstraction layer to facilitate future processor migration

    ### Migration Trigger

    Consider Adyen migration when:
    - Monthly transaction volume exceeds $5M consistently for 3 months
    - EU revenue exceeds 30% of total (local payment methods become important)
    - Fee savings would exceed $50K/year (pays for migration effort)

    | Fee Model | /spikes/payment-processor/fee-analysis.xlsx | Volume-based fee comparison |
    | Architecture Diagram | /spikes/payment-processor/payment-arch.png | Proposed payment system design |

    ## Open Questions

    - [ ] What is the exact timeline for Stripe's pricing negotiation at higher volumes? (Sales said "competitive" but no specifics)
    - [ ] How does PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication affect conversion in EU? Need production data.
    - [ ] Should we implement payment abstraction from day one or wait until migration is certain?

## Real-World Examples

See this skill applied to three different product contexts:

??? example "Storevine (B2B): Storevine B2B ecommerce platform . revenue attribution feasibility spike for Campaigns v1"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /spike-summary

    Spike: Revenue attribution feasibility . can SendGrid open/click webhooks
    be linked to Storevine purchase events within v1 timeline?

    Context:
    - Revenue attribution is a launch-gate requirement (confirmed in interview
      synthesis and opportunity tree)
    - Engineering ADR selected SendGrid for Campaigns email delivery
    - Engineering Lead asked for a 1-week spike before sprint planning

    What we investigated:
    - SendGrid Event Webhook payload structure and custom data fields
    - Whether Storevine's customer_id can survive the email→purchase journey
    - POC: send a test campaign, receive webhook, match to staging order
    - Attribution window design: real-time vs. deferred (7-day)

    Need: full spike summary with findings, recommendation, and follow-up
    items. Will share with PM and Engineering Lead to unblock sprint planning.

??? example "Brainshelf (Consumer): Brainshelf consumer PKM app . topic-matching algorithm spike for the Resurface digest"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /spike-summary

    topic matching spike for resurface. alex spent 3 days on it last
    week. question: can we build something that picks saved items relevant
    to what the user has been reading recently, accurate enough to not
    annoy people?

    three approaches tested:
    1. tag-based . use OG tags, domain, URL patterns. simplest, no ML.
    2. tfidf . extract article text, vectorize, cosine similarity. no
       external api. medium complexity.
    3. openai embeddings . text-embedding-3-small. highest accuracy but
       adds external dependency and per-call cost.

    benchmark: 3 real user libraries (anonymized), 50 items each,
    manually rated as "relevant" or "not relevant" to recent reading.

    results: tags = ~55% [fictional], tfidf = ~72% [fictional],
    embeddings = ~84% [fictional].

    recommendation: go with tfidf for mvp. meets the 70% bar we set,
    no external dependency. plan to migrate to embeddings later if the
    feature sticks.
    ```
