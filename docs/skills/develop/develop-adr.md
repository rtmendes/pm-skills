# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

An Architecture Decision Record documents a significant technical decision along with its context and consequences. ADRs capture the "why" behind architectural choices so future team members understand the reasoning — especially important when they question why something was done a particular way. This skill follows Michael Nygard's lightweight ADR format.

## When to Use

- Making significant technical decisions that affect system architecture
- Choosing between technology options (frameworks, databases, services)
- Establishing patterns that future development should follow
- Documenting the rationale for constraints or non-obvious approaches
- Preserving institutional knowledge about past decisions

## How to Use

Use the `/adr` slash command:

```
/adr "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/develop-adr/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to create an ADR, follow these steps:

1. **Assign a Number and Title**
   ADRs are numbered sequentially (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.) for easy reference. The title should be a short noun phrase describing the decision, like "Use PostgreSQL for order data" or "Adopt React for frontend."

2. **Set the Status**
   New ADRs start as "Proposed." After team review, they become "Accepted," "Deprecated," or "Superseded by ADR-XXX." Status changes should be tracked.

3. **Describe the Context**
   Explain the circumstances that led to this decision. What problem are you solving? What forces are at play (technical constraints, team expertise, timeline, cost)? This section should help a reader who wasn't there understand why this decision was needed.

4. **State the Decision**
   Clearly articulate what you decided. Use active voice: "We will use..." rather than "It was decided..." Be specific about what is and isn't included in the decision.

5. **Document the Consequences**
   List the outcomes of this decision — positive, negative, and neutral. Good ADRs are honest about trade-offs. What becomes easier? What becomes harder? What new constraints or options does this create?

## Example Output

??? example "ADR-007: Use PostgreSQL for Order Data"
    # ADR-007: Use PostgreSQL for Order Data

    ## Status

    Accepted

    **Date:** 2026-01-14
    **Deciders:** Chen Wei (Tech Lead), Sarah Park (Architect), Marcus Johnson (DBA)

    ## Context

    We are building a new order processing service to replace our legacy monolith's order management module. This service will handle approximately 50,000 orders per day initially, with projected growth to 500,000 orders per day within two years.

    The order data has the following characteristics:
    - Strong consistency requirements (cannot lose or duplicate orders)
    - Complex relationships (orders, line items, shipping addresses, payment records)
    - Need for ACID transactions during order creation and updates
    - Regulatory requirement to maintain complete audit history
    - Reporting queries against order data by business analysts

    Our team has experience with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and DynamoDB. The company already runs PostgreSQL in production for other services, with established backup and monitoring infrastructure.

    Timeline pressure exists: we need to launch the new service within 4 months to meet a deprecation deadline for the legacy system.

    ## Decision

    We will use PostgreSQL as the primary database for the order processing service.

    Specifically:
    - PostgreSQL 16 on AWS RDS with Multi-AZ deployment
    - Read replicas for reporting workloads to avoid impacting transactional performance
    - Use of native JSON columns for flexible order metadata while keeping core fields relational
    - Connection pooling via PgBouncer

    ## Consequences

    ### Positive

    - **ACID compliance:** PostgreSQL guarantees the transaction consistency we require for financial data. Order creation spanning multiple tables will either fully succeed or fully rollback.

    - **Team expertise:** Three of our four backend engineers have significant PostgreSQL experience. No ramp-up time required, reducing project risk.

    - **Operational maturity:** We leverage existing PostgreSQL infrastructure, monitoring (Datadog), and backup procedures. Our DBA team is already trained.

    - **Rich query capability:** Complex reporting queries are straightforward with SQL joins. Business analysts can use existing BI tools without learning new query languages.

    - **Schema evolution:** PostgreSQL's migration tooling (we use Flyway) provides controlled schema evolution with rollback capability.

    ### Negative

    - **Horizontal scaling limits:** PostgreSQL scales vertically well but horizontal sharding is complex. If we exceed 500K orders/day significantly, we may need to revisit this decision.

    - **Schema rigidity:** Schema changes require migrations and potentially downtime for large tables. Adding new order attributes requires more planning than a document store.

    - **Cost at scale:** RDS PostgreSQL is more expensive than DynamoDB for high-throughput simple lookups. At 500K orders/day, we estimate $3,200/month vs. $1,800/month for DynamoDB.

    ### Neutral

    - We will need to implement our own soft-delete and audit logging (PostgreSQL doesn't provide this natively like some enterprise databases).

    - Read replica lag (typically <1 second) means reporting data may be slightly behind real-time.

    ## Alternatives Considered

    ### MongoDB

    MongoDB's document model would provide more flexibility for evolving order schemas. However, our need for strong consistency in a distributed write scenario made MongoDB less attractive. The eventual consistency model, while configurable, adds complexity. Additionally, none of our current engineers have production MongoDB experience.

    ### DynamoDB

    DynamoDB would excel at high-throughput single-item lookups and offers seamless horizontal scaling. We rejected it because:
    - Complex queries (e.g., "all orders for customer X in date range Y with status Z") require secondary indexes or full scans
    - No native join capability means denormalizing data or making multiple queries
    - The team would need to learn a new query paradigm and data modeling approach
    - Cost advantage only materializes at scales we may not reach

    ### CockroachDB

    CockroachDB offers PostgreSQL compatibility with built-in horizontal scaling. We considered it for future-proofing but rejected it due to:
    - Less operational experience in our organization
    - Higher complexity for a team our size
    - The PostgreSQL-compatible mode has some limitations that could surprise us

## Real-World Examples

See this skill applied to three different product contexts:

??? example "Storevine (B2B): Storevine B2B ecommerce platform — email sending infrastructure for Campaigns"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /adr

    ADR for email sending infrastructure choice for Campaigns v1. We need to pick
    the vendor before we start the backend build.

    Context: Storevine currently sends transactional emails (order confirm, password
    reset) through SendGrid on a shared IP. Campaigns will add broadcast marketing
    email + 3 automated sequences (abandoned cart, welcome, re-engagement) at
    projected volume of ~2M emails/month at launch [fictional], scaling to ~10M
    at full merchant adoption [fictional].

    Options we evaluated: SendGrid (upgrade to dedicated IP), AWS SES, Postmark,
    Mailgun.

    Key constraints:
    - CAN-SPAM/GDPR compliance is a hard gate before launch
    - Deliverability matters: one spam incident tanks merchant trust
    - We have existing SendGrid integration (transactional)
    - Cost matters but is secondary to deliverability reliability at this stage

    Decision: SendGrid dedicated IP. Need this documented for the record.
    Eng lead and growth PM are the deciders.
    ```

    **Output:**

    # ADR-007: Email Sending Infrastructure for Campaigns

??? example "Brainshelf (Consumer): Brainshelf consumer PKM app — email sending infrastructure decision for the Resurface digest"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /adr

    email sending infra for resurface. we don't have any email sending
    today — everything is in-app or firebase push. need to pick a provider
    for the daily digest.

    options we looked at:
    - sendgrid (twilio): mature, everyone uses it, but their free tier
      shrank and the dashboard is confusing
    - postmark: great deliverability reputation, simple api, but
      transactional only — no batch/digest support without workarounds
    - resend: new, developer-first, react email templates, free tier
      covers our a/b test volume

    alex ran a quick eval last week. we're leaning resend. need the ADR
    written up before sprint 8 starts.
    ```

    **Output:**

    # ADR-007: Use Resend as the Email Sending Provider for the Resurface Digest

??? example "Workbench (Enterprise): Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: ADR for Yjs CRDTs for Blueprint co-editing"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /adr

    ADR: Use Yjs CRDTs for Blueprints real-time co-editing
    Product: Workbench Blueprints
    Stage: Post-CRDT spike; recording architecture decision

    Context:
    - Blueprints requires real-time co-editing (20+ concurrent editors [fictional])
    - ProseMirror-based editor; no current collaboration layer
    - Enterprise requirements: offline-first, conflict resolution, per-user audit trail
    - Spike evaluated Yjs, Automerge, ShareDB

    Decision: Yjs
    - 2-day integration via y-prosemirror; 45ms merge latency at 20 users [fictional]; +38KB gzipped [fictional]; offline-first
    - Automerge rejected: no ProseMirror binding (3-4 week custom build [fictional]); +120KB [fictional]
    - ShareDB rejected: no offline support (disqualified)

    Consequences:
    - Positive: fast integration, offline-first, active community, sub-document support
    - Negative: WebSocket provider TBD, audit trail requires custom middleware, binary document format
    - Neutral: bundle size acceptable for enterprise

    Stakeholders: James W. (VP Engineering), Karen L. (Eng Lead), Nate P. (Backend Engineer)
    ```

    **Output:**

    # ADR-012: Use Yjs CRDTs for Blueprints Real-Time Co-Editing
