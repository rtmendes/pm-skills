# Hypothesis

A hypothesis is a testable prediction about how a change will affect user behavior or business outcomes. It transforms assumptions into explicit statements that can be validated or invalidated through experimentation. Well-formed hypotheses prevent teams from building features based on untested beliefs and create shared understanding of what success looks like.

## When to Use

- After problem framing, before committing to a solution
- When designing experiments or A/B tests
- When team members have differing assumptions about user behavior
- Before investing significant engineering resources in a feature
- When pivoting direction and need to validate the new approach

## How to Use

Use the `/hypothesis` slash command:

```
/hypothesis "Your context here"
```

Or reference the skill file directly: `skills/define-hypothesis/SKILL.md`

## Instructions

When asked to create a hypothesis, follow these steps:

1. **State the Belief**
   Articulate what you believe will happen. Use the structured format: "We believe that [action/change] for [target user] will [expected outcome]." Be specific about the intervention — vague hypotheses can't be tested.

2. **Identify the Target User**
   Define who this hypothesis applies to. A hypothesis about "users" is too broad. Specify the segment: new users in their first week, power users with 10+ sessions, churned users returning, etc.

3. **Define the Expected Outcome**
   What behavior change or result do you expect? Frame it in terms of user actions (complete onboarding, make a purchase, return within 7 days) rather than internal metrics when possible.

4. **Set Success Metrics**
   Choose a primary metric that directly measures the expected outcome. Include secondary metrics that provide context and guardrail metrics that ensure you're not causing harm elsewhere.

5. **Describe Validation Approach**
   How will you test this hypothesis? A/B test, user interviews, prototype testing, cohort analysis? Be specific about sample size, duration, and statistical requirements.

6. **Document Risks and Assumptions**
   What could invalidate this hypothesis beyond the test results? What are you assuming to be true that you haven't validated?

## Example Output

??? example "Hypothesis: Simplified Onboarding Flow"
    # Hypothesis: Simplified Onboarding Flow

    ## Hypothesis Statement

    **We believe that** reducing the onboarding flow from 7 steps to 3 essential steps

    **for** new users signing up for a free trial

    **will** increase onboarding completion rate

    **as measured by** percentage of users who complete all onboarding steps within their first session

    ## Background & Rationale

    ### Problem Context

    Our SaaS product has a 34% onboarding completion rate — meaning 66% of new signups never finish setup and experience the core value proposition. User research indicates the current 7-step onboarding feels overwhelming, with significant drop-off occurring at steps 4 and 5 (team invitation and integration setup). Users who don't complete onboarding are 4x more likely to churn within 14 days.

    ### Supporting Evidence

    - Session recordings show users hesitating and abandoning at the team invitation step
    - Support tickets frequently ask "Can I skip some of these steps?"
    - Competitor analysis shows market leaders use 3-4 step onboarding flows
    - Exit survey data: 42% of churned users cite "too complicated to get started"
    - Hotjar heatmaps show users scrolling to find a "skip" button that doesn't exist

    ### Alternative Hypotheses Considered

    - **Progress indicators:** Adding a progress bar might reduce anxiety without changing steps — rejected because underlying issue is step count, not visibility
    - **Tooltips/guidance:** More help content might reduce confusion — rejected because it adds more cognitive load
    - **Optional steps:** Making steps skippable might work — considered as fallback if simplification fails

    ## Target User Segment

    ### Definition

    New users who:
    - Sign up for a free trial (not paid conversion from trial)
    - Are the first user from their organization (not invited team members)
    - Access the product via web (not mobile app)

    ### Segment Size

    - 12,400 new trial signups per month meeting these criteria
    - 8,200 (66%) currently fail to complete onboarding

    ### Current Behavior

    - Average time to complete current onboarding: 18 minutes
    - Step 1-3 completion: 78%
    - Step 4 (team invitation) completion: 52%
    - Step 5 (integration) completion: 41%
    - Full completion (all 7 steps): 34%
    - Users who complete onboarding activate core feature within 24h: 89%

    ## Success Metrics

    ### Primary Metric

    | Metric | Current Baseline | Target | Minimum Detectable Effect |
    |--------|-----------------|--------|--------------------------|
    | Onboarding completion rate | 34% | 50% | 10% relative lift |

    ### Secondary Metrics

    | Metric | Current Baseline | Expected Direction |
    |--------|-----------------|-------------------|
    | Time to complete onboarding | 18 min | Decrease to <8 min |
    | Day-1 core feature activation | 30% | Increase |
    | Support tickets (first 24h) | 8.2% of users | Decrease |
    | User satisfaction (post-onboarding) | 3.2/5 | Increase |

    ### Guardrail Metrics

    | Metric | Current Value | Acceptable Range |
    |--------|--------------|------------------|
    | 14-day trial-to-paid conversion | 12% | No decrease >5% relative |
    | Team invitation rate (within 7 days) | 23% | No decrease >10% relative |
    | Integration connection rate (within 7 days) | 31% | No decrease >10% relative |

    ## Validation Approach

    ### Method

    A/B test with 50/50 traffic split between:
    - **Control:** Current 7-step onboarding flow
    - **Treatment:** New 3-step onboarding (account basics, workspace setup, first task creation)

    Deferred steps (team invitation, integrations) will be prompted via in-app messaging after initial activation.

    ### Sample Size & Duration

    - Sample size: 3,000 users per variant (6,000 total)
    - Duration: 14 days of enrollment + 7 days observation window
    - Traffic allocation: 50% control / 50% treatment
    - Statistical significance: 95% confidence level
    - Statistical power: 80%

    ### Pass/Fail Criteria

    - **Validated if:** Onboarding completion increases by ≥10% relative (34% → 37.4%+) with 95% confidence AND guardrail metrics stay within acceptable range
    - **Invalidated if:** Onboarding completion shows no significant change or decreases, OR guardrail metrics breach acceptable range
    - **Inconclusive if:** Results don't reach statistical significance within test window — extend test or increase sample

    ## Risks & Assumptions

    ### Key Assumptions

    - Users who complete a shorter onboarding will still discover team/integration features later
    - The 3 essential steps are sufficient to demonstrate core product value
    - In-app prompts can effectively drive deferred actions
    - Onboarding completion is a leading indicator of retention (not just correlated)

    ### Risks

    - **Feature discovery risk:** Users might never set up teams/integrations if not prompted during onboarding
    - **Segment spillover:** Results might not generalize to invited users or mobile signups
    - **Novelty effect:** Initial lift might fade as users become accustomed to flow
    - **Selection bias:** Users who would have completed 7-step flow might be different from marginal completers

## Real-World Examples

See this skill applied to three different product contexts:

??? example "Storevine (B2B): Storevine B2B ecommerce platform — Campaigns v1 first-campaign guided flow hypothesis"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /hypothesis

    Project: Campaigns — native email marketing for Storevine merchants
    Stage: Post-discovery, pre-PRD finalization

    Hypothesis I want to define:
    - Non-adopter merchants (no active external email tool, <250 customers)
      are ~38% of our active base [fictional] and represented 3 of 8 merchant
      interview participants (P3, P6, and P8)
    - Core belief: setup complexity is the barrier — not awareness or price
    - Specific hypothesis: a guided first-campaign flow with product-seeded
      templates will drive first-send rate from ~12% [fictional] to ≥30%
      [fictional] within 60 days of GA

    Prior work to reference:
    - Merchant interview synthesis (Jan 12–28, 2026): P3, P6, and P8 described
      email as "too overwhelming to start" or perennially "on the list"
    - Competitive analysis (Feb 2026): Shopify Email's template-first + free
      tier activation is their primary new-merchant onboarding lever
    - Problem statement: email-related churn estimated at 4.8 pp [fictional]
      of overall 22% [fictional] annual merchant churn rate

    Need: full hypothesis document with success metrics, validation approach,
    pass/fail criteria, and risks. Will attach to PRD as primary testable belief.
    ```

    # Hypothesis: Pre-Populated Templates Drive First Campaign Sends for Non-Adopter Merchants

??? example "Brainshelf (Consumer): Brainshelf consumer PKM app — Resurface morning email digest hypothesis"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /hypothesis

    trying to figure out if a morning digest email will actually get people to re-read
    their saved stuff. context: brainshelf pkm app, 22k MAU [fictional]. users save
    ~47 items/month but only go back to read ~9% within 30 days [fictional]. classic
    guilt pile problem from interviews.

    want to run an A/B test on a morning email that surfaces 3-5 items from their
    library based on what they've been reading lately. need a hypothesis doc to
    align the team before we commit to building it.

    primary metric: resurface item click rate. secondary: actual read completion.
    guardrail: don't tank unsubscribe rate.
    ```

    **Output:**

    # Hypothesis: Morning Resurface Email Increases Re-Read Rate

??? example "Workbench (Enterprise): Workbench enterprise collaboration platform: required-section enforcement hypothesis"
    **Prompt:**

    ```
    /hypothesis

    Product: Workbench Blueprints (enterprise doc templates with required sections and approval gates)
    Stage: Define phase, post-discovery interviews and problem statement

    Hypothesis: Requiring all Blueprint sections to be completed before an author can submit for approval will reduce median time to first approved Blueprint.

    Context:
    - 38% of Blueprints in closed beta reach approval with ≥1 empty required section [fictional]
    - Median time to first approval: 4.0 days [fictional]
    - Most rejections are for missing content, not quality [fictional]
    - Approvers (dept heads, compliance leads) are the bottleneck -- they reject and wait, or approve with risk
    - Target: reduce median approval time to ≤1 day [fictional] (aspirational)
    - MDE for experiment: 1.0 day reduction (to ≤3.0 days) [fictional]

    Target users: Project leads and document authors at enterprise Workbench accounts
    Validation: A/B test in closed beta (80 accounts, ~300 Blueprints/week [fictional])
    Primary metric: median time-to-first-approval (days)
    Guardrails: author abandonment, author NPS

    Stakeholders: Sandra C. (Head of Product), Karen L. (Eng Lead), Leo M. (Data Analyst)
    ```
