# Workflows

Workflows chain multiple skills into end-to-end sequences. Each workflow defines a sequence of skills to run in order.

## How to use a workflow

```
/workflow-feature-kickoff "Feature name or description"
```

Each workflow has a corresponding `/workflow-{name}` slash command. You can also reference the workflow file directly.
