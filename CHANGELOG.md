## [2.8.0] - 2026-04-03 ([release notes](docs/releases/Release_v2.8.0.md))

### Added
- **F-10: utility-pm-skill-validate skill** (#121) — second utility skill. Audits existing skills against structural conventions (mirroring CI) and LLM-assessed quality criteria. Produces a pipe-delimited validation report (`Report schema: v1`) with severity-graded findings (FAIL/WARN/INFO) and actionable recommendations with target file paths. Two-tier assessment rebaselined against shipped library conventions. Includes SKILL.md, TEMPLATE.md (report format), EXAMPLE.md (validated `deliver-prd`), `/pm-skill-validate` command, and AGENTS.md entry. Skill count: 27 → 28.
- **F-11: utility-pm-skill-iterate skill** (#122) — third utility skill. Applies targeted improvements to existing skills from feedback, validation reports, or convention changes. Unified flow with input normalization, before/after preview, stale-preview guard, version bump class suggestion (don't auto-write), and HISTORY.md creation at second-version trigger point. Includes SKILL.md, TEMPLATE.md (change summary), EXAMPLE.md (iterated `deliver-prd`), `/pm-skill-iterate` command, and AGENTS.md entry. Skill count: 28 → 29.
- **M-18: CI skill versioning validation** — two new advisory scripts following `.sh` + `.ps1` + `.md` convention: `validate-skill-history` (checks HISTORY.md tracks current frontmatter version) and `validate-skills-manifest` (checks release manifest entries match skill directories). Added to `validation.yml` with `continue-on-error: true`.
- **D-03: `docs/pm-skill-lifecycle.md`** — public guide explaining the Create → Validate → Iterate lifecycle with workflow patterns (new skill, improve existing, convention change, feedback loop), CI vs validator comparison, and quality standard model.
- **Governance: `docs/internal/skill-versioning.md`** — SemVer rules for skills, HISTORY.md contract, skills-manifest.yaml format, release checklist, and tie-breaker rule for gray-area version bump classification.
- `docs/internal/release-plans/v2.7.0/skills-manifest.yaml` — retroactive first use of the skills-manifest convention.
- `docs/internal/release-plans/v2.8.0/` — release governance with phased execution plan and Codex design review.

### Changed
- **D-04: public docs refresh for v2.8.0** — updated skill counts (29), command counts (30), utility skill breakdown (3), Skill Lifecycle Tools section in README and QUICKSTART, command table, AGENTS.md entries, AGENTS/claude/CONTEXT.md, `docs/pm-skill-anatomy.md` lifecycle cross-reference, and `scripts/README_SCRIPTS.md` with M-18 script documentation.
- `docs/internal/releases/` renamed to `docs/internal/release-plans/` with all internal references updated (34 files).
- `docs/internal/backlog-canonical.md` updated with v2.8.0 assignments (F-10, F-11, D-03, M-18, D-04).

### Release Notes
- Completes the **PM skill lifecycle**: Create (`/pm-skill-builder`, v2.7.0) → Validate (`/pm-skill-validate`) → Iterate (`/pm-skill-iterate`).
- First release with **skill versioning governance** — skills-manifest.yaml per release, HISTORY.md per skill (opt-in), SemVer tie-breaker rule.
- First release with **advisory CI for skill versioning** — HISTORY.md and skills-manifest.yaml validators.
- Repo now contains 29 skills (25 domain + 1 foundation + 3 utility), 30 command docs, and 3 workflow bundles.
- **MCP note**: `pm-skills-mcp` needs a re-embed to pick up both new skills. `utility-pm-skill-validate` → `pm_pm_skill_validate`. `utility-pm-skill-iterate` → `pm_pm_skill_iterate`.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-22 ([release notes](docs/releases/Release_v2.7.0.md))

### Added
- **F-06: deliver-acceptance-criteria skill** (#114) — new Deliver phase skill for Given/When/Then acceptance criteria generation covering happy path, edge cases, error states, and non-functional criteria. Includes SKILL.md, TEMPLATE.md, EXAMPLE.md (e-commerce checkout scenario), `/acceptance-criteria` command, and AGENTS.md entry. Skill count: 25 → 26.
- **F-05: utility-pm-skill-builder skill** (#113) — first utility-classified skill. Interactive builder that guides contributors from a PM skill idea to a complete Skill Implementation Packet with gap analysis, Why Gate, classification, exemplar-driven drafting, and staging-to-promotion workflow. Includes SKILL.md, TEMPLATE.md, EXAMPLE.md (change-communication scenario), `/pm-skill-builder` command, and AGENTS.md Utility Skills section. Skill count: 26 → 27.
- **M-12: CI validation enhancement** (#112) — extended linter with description word count (20-100) and TEMPLATE.md header count (≥3) checks; new `validate-agents-md` script for AGENTS.md ↔ skill directory sync; new `check-mcp-impact` advisory script for MCP impact detection. All scripts follow `.sh + .ps1 + .md` convention.
- **M-16: exclude docs/internal from release ZIP** (#123) — release packagers (`build-release.sh` and `.ps1`) now strip `docs/internal/**` from staged artifacts. Internal governance docs stay tracked in-repo but no longer ship to end users.
- **D-01: `docs/pm-skill-anatomy.md`** — practical guide to pm-skills skill structure covering directory layout, classification types, frontmatter, Triple Diamond phases, wiring layer, and CI validation. Complements the spec-level `docs/agent-skill-anatomy.md`.
- `_staging/` added to `.gitignore` for pm-skill-builder draft artifacts.

### Changed
- **D-02: public docs review for v2.7.0** — updated skill counts (27), command counts (28), M-12 script documentation, domain/foundation/utility classification model, skill template modernization, frontmatter schema with utility example, and `docs/agent-skill-anatomy.md` scope note. Post-F-05 reconciliation patched 3 stale references.
- Fixed duplicate workflow steps in `validation.yml` (validate-agents-md and check-mcp-impact each ran twice).
- AGENTS.md gains a `### Utility Skills` section and `/pm-skill-builder` in the Commands table.
- `docs/internal/backlog-canonical.md` rewritten with Release, Status, and Agent columns.
- Release governance folders created for v2.2.0, v2.3.0, and v2.7.0 (v2.2.0 and v2.3.0 migrated from legacy locations).

### Removed
- `docs/internal/delivery-plan/` — legacy directory removed from tracking.
- `docs/internal/release-planning/` — legacy directory removed from tracking.

### Release Notes
- First release with a **utility** skill classification — `pm-skill-builder` creates new PM skills interactively.
- First release with enhanced CI: frontmatter linting, AGENTS.md sync validation, MCP impact detection.
- Release ZIPs now exclude `docs/internal/**` while preserving all public documentation.
- Repo now contains 27 skills (25 domain + 1 foundation + 1 utility), 28 command docs, and 3 workflow bundles.
- **MCP note**: `pm-skills-mcp` needs a re-embed to pick up both new skills. `deliver-acceptance-criteria` → `pm_acceptance_criteria`. `utility-pm-skill-builder` → `pm_pm_skill_builder` (double `pm_` is intentional — preserves skill name, consistent with future `pm_agent_skill_builder`). Update `embed-skills.js` to strip classification prefixes (`foundation-`, `utility-`) alongside phase prefixes.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- **MCP Alignment Milestone** — pm-skills-mcp v2.1.0 now fully aligned with flat structure
- Version alignment table in ecosystem documentation

### Changed
- Updated ecosystem documentation noting MCP v2.1 compatibility
- Clarified that pm-skills-mcp v2.1+ is required for full compatibility with pm-skills v2.x flat structure

### Ecosystem
- pm-skills-mcp v2.1.0 released with:
  - Flat resource URIs: `pm-skills://skills/{skill}`
  - Phase read from frontmatter, not path
  - Tool names remain stable (`pm_prd`, `pm_hypothesis`, etc.)

## [2.0.1] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- Validation workflow (`validation.yml`) running command + front-matter checks on Ubuntu and Windows.
- Front-matter lint scripts (`scripts/lint-skills-frontmatter.sh` / `.ps1`) that verify required keys, directory-name alignment, and reference files.
- Noted command validator scripts in project structure/README.
- Scripts guide renamed to `scripts/README_SCRIPTS.md` to avoid name collisions.

### Changed
- Removed nested `metadata.version` fields from all skills; lint now enforces a single root version and required keys.
- Parameterized build scripts (`build-release.sh` / `.ps1`) and release workflows to derive artifact names from the tag/ref (defaulting to v2.0.1); added zip/hash fallbacks for Windows.
- `validate-commands` now reports multi-skill bundles (e.g., `/kickoff`) without misleading first-path-only output.
- README path examples updated to `skills/{phase-skill}/`; AGENTS.md clarifies bundle links are repo-relative; release workflow typo fixed (`openskills`).
- Moved skill templates to `docs/templates/` and updated references (authoring guide, README, project-structure, AGENTS context).
- README refresh: expanded v2.0 highlights, updated project structure tree, roadmap in-progress items, note that pm-skills-mcp v1.x is outdated (v2.1 underway).
- `docs/reference/project-structure.md` now has a table of contents, updated directory tree, full commands list, and template path.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-26

### Breaking
- Repository flattened to `skills/{phase-skill}/` (hyphen-only). All prior nested `skills/<phase>/<skill>/` paths removed.
- Slash commands now point to the flat skill paths; update local references/scripts accordingly.

### Added
- Sync helpers `scripts/sync-claude.sh` and `scripts/sync-claude.ps1` to regenerate `.claude/skills` and `.claude/commands` for Claude Code / openskills discovery with validation.
- Build scripts `scripts/build-release.sh` and `scripts/build-release.ps1` to create `pm-skills-v2.0.zip` with manifest/hash (excludes populated `.claude`).
- `.claude/pm-skills-for-claude.md` usage note for discovery.

### Changed
- All 24 skills renamed to flat `{phase-skill}` directories; SKILL front matter updated with `phase`, `version: 2.0.0`, and `updated: 2026-01-26`.
- Docs refreshed to reflect flat structure and two-path install story (flat source vs. optional `.claude/` via sync helper), including README, QUICKSTART, AGENTS, bundles, guides, and references.
- Workflows (`release.yml`, `release-zips.yml`) call the new build-release script.
- `.gitignore` now excludes `.claude/skills`, `.claude/commands`, and `dist/`.

### Validation
- Path scan confirms no residual `skills/<phase>/` references in public docs/commands.
- Front-matter check: all `skills/*/SKILL.md` include required `name`, `phase`, `version`, `updated`.
